        "content": "It had been a long day for the Dalai Lama. Even by the time he had eaten his meager breakfast of tsampa and tea at 7:30 A.M., he had already been up for four hours, completing his rigorous daily regimen of prayer, study, and meditation. After breakfast he began his usual workday, and that day there was a full lineup: meeting with one person after another, he saw an Indian government liaison officer, the head lama of one of the ancient lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, the president of a member republic of the Russian Federation, a high official in the Tibetan government-in-exile, and various members of his private office staff. And scheduled among these private meetings, I watched with admiration as he met with a group of newly arrived Ti"

They had made the arduous journey across the Himalayas by any means of conveyance they could find, lucky if they could afford a ride on an antediluvian bus, but more likely to have caught a lift, riding in the open bed of a shuddering pickup truck. Some had crossed the rugged border on foot, climbing high-altitude passes with grim determination. Here and there one could see a child missing a finger or a toe casualties of frostbite. Many arrived penniless, destitute, their traditional chubas (native Tibetan costumes) tattered and dusty from the long journey. In some of the older faces, ruddy faces, weathered and creased by winds and harsh climate, one could detect traces of untold suffering, spirits hardened by years of mistreatment at the hands of the Chinese Communists. For many of these people, however, a mere glimpse of the Dalai Lama, the fulfillment of a lifelong dream, was enough to revive their withered spirits and infuse them with renewed hope and joy. He offered them all, young and old, words of hope and encouragement, as well as hardheaded practical advice, ranging from <Education is critical to success> to <Now you men should be careful of going with prostitutes\u2014you could catch a disease.> Finally, it was 2 P.M., his last scheduled appointment for the day. And here was I. I had been allotted several hours each afternoon to collaborate on our book, and I was here to collect. Our meetings were far from chatty tete-a-tetes, however. In fact, I often gave him no end of difficulty as we struggled to reconcile East and West, pestering him with endless questions, a fair proportion of which he labeled so silly or impossible to an"

Standing outside on his bougainvillea-draped porch, with the majestic snowcapped Dhauladhar Mountains of northern India as a backdrop, the Dalai Lama greeted me warmly as he led me inside his home. Little had changed in this room since our first meeting twenty years before. The same traditional Tibetan thanka paintings lined the pale yellow walls, the same Buddhist shrine covered with ornate Buddhist icons at one end of the room, and the same floor-to-ceiling relief map of Tibet dominating the opposite wall. Even the modest furniture appeared to be the same, although it's possible the sofa may have been reupholstered. As I unpacked my notebooks and fumbled with my tape recorder, we spoke casually about some of his activities and meetings earlier that day. The Dalai Lama generally scheduled our meetings for his last appointment of the day, so as I loitered in the attached reception room waiting for our meeting to begin, I often had the opportunity to observe the collection of individuals who came to meet with him. On that day in particular I was struck by the diversity of individuals seeking his time and counsel, people coming to visit him from all corners of the earth. Thinking about this as I began our session, I said, <You know, I couldn't help but notice how many different kinds of people come to see you, people with various professions, all sorts of jobs. And I was thinking about how you also are involved in so many different kinds of activities. Now, this week I want to focus on the topic of work>"

Good.> The Dalai Lama nodded. <And since we're going to be talking about work this week, I was just curious, what do you consider to be your primary job?> The Dalai Lama looked puzzled. <What do you mean?> I was puzzled why he was puzzled. It seemed to be a simple question. <Well, in the West,> I explained, <when you meet somebody, often the first question you ask a stranger is, 'What do you do?' meaning specifically, 'What kind of work do you do? What's your job?' So, if you met a complete stranger and they didn't know you or had never heard of the Dalai Lama and they didn't even know what your monk's robes signified, they just met you as a human being and they asked you, 'What do you do for a living?' what would you tell them?> The Dalai Lama reflected in silence for a long while, and finally declared, <Nothing. I do nothing.> Nothing? In response to my blank stare, he repeated himself. <If I was suddenly posed with this question that would probably be my answer. Nothing.> Nothing? I didn't buy it. He clearly worked as hard as anyone I knew, harder even. And as grueling as this day had been, it was light duty compared to his schedule during his frequent trips abroad. In fact, informally attached to his small staff on a speaking tour of the U.S. the year before, I had witnessed a remarkable display of relentless activity, dedication, and hard work: as a statesman, he had met with President George W Bush, Secretary of State Colin Powell, and a host of high-ranking senators and members of Congress.

In fact, I recently read a survey that reported that nearly half of American workers are dissatisfied at work, unhappy with their jobs. I've talked to some experts who say that the number may even be higher than that. And things seem to be getting worse. According to the Conference Board, the nonprofit organization that conducted the survey, that same survey showed that over the past five or six years the percentage of people who are satisfied with their job has dropped by around eight percent.> The Dalai Lama appeared surprised. <Why is that?> he asked. <Well, according to the studies I've read, there may be a variety of reasons, ranging from inadequate compensation, or simple boredom, to more complex factors related to the specific nature of the work or the workplace conditions. There are all sorts of things that can make a person miserable at work: poor social atmosphere, lack of recognition, not enough variety, and other things. In fact, I'd be interested in hearing your opinion on each one of these factors. But let me give you an example.

They had no sense of autonomy, no freedom to do their work in their own way. They both complained that they didn't get enough information and direction from their bosses, but once they were finally given a clear-cut task or assignment, they wanted to carry out the assignment in their own way. Instead, the supervisor seemed to be standing over them breathing down their necks, giving them no room for creativity or personal initiative. They resented the fact that not only didn't they have any control over the kind of work they are required to do, they couldn't even choose how to go about doing it. <So, do you have any thoughts about how a person could go about increasing their feeling of autonomy or freedom at work?> <I don't know,> the Dalai Lama responded. <Of course it will completely depend on the person's individual circumstances, what position they are in.> <Any general suggestions?> He reflected for a moment. <Let's take the example of a prisoner. Now of course it is best not to be in prison, but even in that situation, where a person may be deprived of freedom, he or she may discover small choices that they are able to make. And even if somebody is in prison, with very rigid rules, they can undertake some spiritual practices to try to lessen their mental frustrations, try to get some peace of mind.

Isn't it? So, perhaps that would help. <Of course, when you are talking about rigid rules and lack of freedom, that doesn't mean that you are required to blindly follow and accept everything others tell you. In instances where the worker might be exploited, where the employer thinks of nothing but profit and pays a small salary and demands a lot of overtime, or where one may be asked to do things that are not appropriate or are unethical, one should not simply think, Well, this is my karma, and take no action.

The Buddhist texts mention what is called 'misplaced tolerance,' or 'misplaced forbearance.' So, for example, in the case of Tibetans, in the face of Chinese injustice generally, misplaced patience or forbearance refers to the sense of endurance that some individuals have when they are subject to a very destructive, negative activity.

The genuine curiosity in his voice suggested that he had never heard of the concept. <Well, you know,> I said, struggling for words, <where you are overloaded with work, and it becomes a source of stress.> <I still don't know what you mean by this term 'overload.' For example, your boss could give you some work which you could probably finish within a certain amount of time, but that's not overload because it is something you can accomplish, even if it is difficult. Or he could give you an amount of work that is impossible to finish in a certain amount of time, in which case you simply have to say 'I can't do this.' So, what do you mean?> He wasn't getting it. But I failed to understand why he didn't get it. The concept of work overload isn't some obscure American custom, or even something unique to Western culture. After all, the Japanese have even coined the word karoshi\u2014death by work overload. I decided to frame it in his terms. <Well, let's say you're a young monk and you're studying and practicing Buddhism. So your teacher would be the equivalent of your boss.> <O.K., right.> He nodded. <I understand.> <And your job is to learn and memorize certain texts, so let's say your boss gives you a text that you need to memorize by next week.

We have to deeply reflect on whether responding in this way brings a happier and more peaceful state of mind, or if those emotions serve to make us more unhappy. And we need to relate it to our own past experiences, thinking about the effect that these emotions have on our physical health, as well as our mental state. Think about times when you felt strong jealousy or hatred in the past and find out whether it made your life more satisfying or helped you achieve your goals. Think about how others responded to you when you were showing strong anger or jealousy, and analyze whether that helped you to have better relationships. So, think about these things until you are fully convinced of how damaging it is to ourselves to constantly respond to situations with hostility or jealousy, and how beneficial are the positive emotions like tolerance or contentment.< >O.K.

You can be resentful and angry, but then you can think about how destructive that kind of mental state can be.

There will always be better jobs that you don't have. Don't continue to feel competitive or jealous. That only brings more worry, more dissatisfaction. >But you still need a way to bring some kind of peace of mind. Here's where we need to use our capacity for critical thinking, for analysis. You begin by realizing that no situation is one hundred percent good or one hundred percent bad. Sometimes, particularly in the West, I've noticed a tendency to think in black-or-white terms. But in reality everything in life is relative. So, based on this reality, you can cultivate a wider perspective of the situation and try to see different angles. You can further analyze, realizing that with the better work and more money, that doesn't mean that you would have no problems. Some other jobs may have higher pay, but they come at a price, maybe longer hours or more responsibility and maybe risk of injury or other kinds of problems.

In this case, for instance, while at SUNY Buffalo, Robert Rice, PhD, a prolific scholar in the field of job satisfaction, led a group that conducted a surprising study. Contrary to what one might expect, they found that those with more important jobs are no happier in life than those with less important jobs. This finding has been replicated in a number of similar wide-scale studies showing that while job satisfaction is linked with life satisfaction, the specific type of work one does, one's occupational prestige, or whether a person is blue collar or white collar, has little impact on one's overall life satisfaction. There's an additional reason why it is sometimes a long and difficult process to reshape our attitudes and outlook, to change the habitual ways that we perceive the world, modify our customary interpretation and response to any given situation or event. What's the reason? When it comes down to it, many of us resist giving up our misery\u2014a vexing and baffling feature of human behavior I often observed in the past when treating psychotherapy patients. As miserable as some people might be, for many there is a kind of perverse pleasure in the self-righteous indignation one feels when one is treated unfairly. We hold on to our pain, wear it like a badge, it becomes part of us and we are reluctant to give it up. After all, at least our characteristic ways of looking at the world are familiar. Letting go of our customary responses, as destructive as they may be, may seem frightening, and often that fear abides on a deeply ingrained subconscious level.

An instant later the electricity went off, an almost daily occurrence during this season in Dharamsala. The Dalai Lama was completely unruffled. In fact, his warm smile and cheerful manner were set off in bold relief against the darkened room and the ice storm raging outside. Clearly here was a happy man. Everything about him bespoke the possibility of leading a happy life despite life's inevitable troubles. He himself had weathered his fair share of problems, the loss of an entire nation as he was forced into exile as a result of the Communist Chinese invasion and occupation of Tibet. And he continued to tackle difficult problems on a daily basis\u2014struggling to preserve his cultural heritage, fighting for the freedom of his people, for the human rights of all people. And often without success. Yet since the age of six, he had been engaged in the training of his mind, learning how to remain happy despite life's unavoidable adversities. It seems to have paid off.

It sounded to me like an episode of the TV show Survivor. In virtually every study of workplace conditions and the factors that contribute to employee satisfaction or dissatisfaction, the social climate of the organization plays a prominent role. Leading scholars in the emerging field of positive psychology, such as James Harter, Frank Schmidt, and Corey Keyes, in reviewing the existing literature on well-being at work, have found social interaction to be an important element in job satisfaction. Numerous researchers, including sociologist Karen Loscocco, while working at SUNY Albany, or Sheila Henderson conducting research at Stanford University, confirmed the key role of social atmosphere in employee satisfaction. In addition to providing greater satisfaction at the workplace, <workrelated social support> was also found to be a factor in a person's general state of well-being. It is of little surprise, therefore, that in our discussions about happiness at work, sooner or later we were bound to touch upon the subject of relationships at work\u2014the human factor. Resuming our conversation late the following afternoon, the Dalai Lama began, <There may be many factors or variables that affect the degree to which work contributes to happiness, and it depends on each individual's circumstances, make-up, and so on.

He seemed to take great delight in speaking about human values, no matter how many times he had spoken of them before. So with a tone of genuine interest and enthusiasm, he resumed. >You know, one thing that I think is crucial to keep in mind when talking about human values, compassion, and so on, is that these are not simply religious subjects.

After all, humans are social animals, we are built to work cooperatively with others for our survival. No matter how powerful a single person may be, without other human companions, that individual person cannot survive. And certainly, without friends he or she cannot lead a happy and fulfilling life.

We should try our best to accept responsibility for our own emotions, practice tolerance, and try to reduce jealousy, although of course it isn't always easy and people will have varying degrees of success. <But generally speaking, one could start by recognizing that we are all interdependent, we all depend on one another for our livelihood. That is the place we could start. The deeper our appreciation of that fact, that reality, the greater our willingness to work cooperatively with others will be. Sometimes we have a sort of feeling that we are separate from others, independent, the kind of feeling that I earn my own money, I support myself, so who needs others? Especially when we are young and healthy, there's that tendency to think I can manage alone-, I do not need to care about others. But no matter what kind of job we have, there are many other co-workers who contribute in their own way to the running of the company that we depend on for our livelihood. Without them, the company simply would not exist, and we would not be able to earn our living, not to mention our cus"

That's the key factor. Have a clear understanding of that reality. At least on that basis one will be more willing to work cooperatively with others, whether or not one has any special feeling of affection or compassion toward them. On that level, on the level of building teamwork, compassion or empathy is not even required. However, if you want to enhance and strengthen the relationship, move it to a deeper and much more satisfying level, then empathy and compassion would be required.

        "content": "ing to cultivate a deeper compassion for others, that compassion should be unbiased, ideally it should be directed toward everyone equally. That's genuine compassion, universal compassion. For example, often we think of compassion as something that is directed toward those who are worse off than you, less fortunate people who are poor or in some difficult circumstances. There, of course, compassion is a completely appropriate response. But often if someone is more wealthy than you are, or famous, or enjoying some fortunate circumstances, we feel that they are not appropriate objects for our compassion. Our compassion dries up, and we may feel jealousy instead. But if you look deeper, no matter how rich or famous someone is, they are still a human being just like you, subject to the changes of life, of old age, illness, loss, and so on. Even if it is not apparent on the surface, sooner or later they are subject to suffering. They are worthy of compassion on that basis, on the basis of being a fellow human being. So, this relates specifically to the workplace, where people are often in conflict with their supervisors, bosses, but one is more likely to feel envy, fear, or hostility rather than to think of them merely as another human being, as worthy of your compassion as anyone else. <So, this brings me to the final approach to dealing with difficult people at work, these trying situations. And this depends entirely on the basic outlook, orientation, and personal interest of the individual. But in this regard, there are some people who have an interest in spirituality, those people who are trying to train their minds, to cultivate spiritual values like compassion, patience, tolerance, and forgiveness. Now, for those people, they may use these challenging situations as part of their spiri"

But this has to do with one's internal response and reaction to conflicts at work, or to situations that may cause emotions like anger, hatred, or jealousy to arise. And this approach is definitely possible. In my experience, for instance, I have met many Tibetans who have been imprisoned, political prisoners, by the Chinese for many years, being beaten, starved, tortured. And yet they were able to use their spiritual practices even in these extreme conditions, and in some cases even strengthen their spiritual practice while maintaining compassion even toward their captors. >For example, there was one senior monk who was imprisoned by the Chinese for many years. A group of his students was also in the same prison. I once met a monk who was one of the students of this senior monk. He told me that all of them were mistreated and abused in this prison, but it was especially hard on the students when they saw their teacher being beaten and humiliated. They became very angry. But the teacher advised them not to be overcome by hatred, that this was in fact an opportunity for inner development.

As we had discussed the previous day, there was no doubt that a poor social climate, one full of conflict and jealousy, can make work a nightmare. Yet according to a Gallup survey, Americans generally tend to be more satisfied with the social aspects of their job than they are with matters of recognition, how much they feel valued at work. And for many people, one's salary or pay is viewed as an objective measure of how much they are valued by their employer. But in today's society, one's pay level often represents much more than that. It not only reflects how much one is valued by the employer, but how much money a person makes can be intimately connected with how one values himself or herself. It can be linked with our own sense of self-worth."

But the problem was, of course, that there were other days when I could lose as much. So for thirty years I was bouncing up and down like a basketball\u2014during the periods I was making money, when I was winning,' I was unbelievably high. I felt like I could do no wrong, and my clients who were getting rich all heaped praise on me, telling me what a genius I was. And of course I agreed, I deserved every bit of their praise, I felt like I was the smartest guy on the planet. And during those times I'd be impatient, judgmental, and intolerant of others. But then there were the other times, the down times when people were losing money, even going bust. During those periods I would often sink into severe depression, I felt ashamed, and sometimes I'd just stay home and get drunk. Which of course didn't help things. I felt like a total failure, an idiot, and I'd even be afraid to face my clients. It got to the point a couple of times where I even felt suicidal.> For most of us, the link between how much money we make and our self-esteem isn't as dramatic as it was for this broker. But it illustrates an important principle. If we choose an external marker as the measure of our inner worth, whether it is the amount of money we make, or others' opinion of us, or the success of some project we're involved in, sooner or later we're bound to be battered by life's inevitable changes.

These people are particularly prone to intense resentment and dissatisfaction if they feel that they are unfairly compensated for their efforts. Thus, in our discussion about work and jobs, there was no avoiding the issue of money, and I was curious to hear the Dalai Lama's thoughts on the subject. <I'd like to turn to the topic of money,> I began. <Of course, when we speak of money, that is a vast subject that can be approached from a variety of angles, but for the purposes of this discussion, since we're focusing on work, I'd like your general thoughts about money as the primary motivation for one's work.> <Yes. I believe that for many their attitude toward their job would be simply to make money,> the Dalai Lama affirmed. <There is nothing wrong in this. Since to survive in a modern industrial society everyone needs to find their own way of making a living, this attitude toward work as primarily a source of one's livelihood is very realistic. Particularly if the individual has a family, especially young children, to support through his or her job, there is in fact a dimension to work that is noble.

It is the value that we as a society agree to give to it that makes it valuable. The paper itself is worth very little. Its real worth is the cost of the paper it is printed on. It may sound silly, but I think it is important sometimes to be reminded of this simple fact. <The trouble with pursuing money just for the sake of money is that this makes us a victim of greed, never-ending greed. Then we are never satisfied. We become slaves of money. I have some friends, I think I have told you about some of them in the past, who run here and there, travel all over the world in quest of more and more money, so sometimes I tease them, calling them slaves of money. But they never stop to think about why they are doing this, other than to make more money. Now, if such a pursuit did succeed in giving them the happiness and sense of fulfillment they seek in life, then I suppose there would be some justification for this. This, however, is not the case. In fact, the real problem is that they are never content with anything. Unless you become one of the few richest people in the world, which, in any case, is extremely unlikely, there is always going to be someone who has much more money than you. And when you obtain something, then you want something else. If you make a million, you want ten million, and when you have ten, you want a hundred million. So unless we learn to say 'that's enough for me,' we can never be truly contented.

If someone is economically deprived, desperately poor, then the practice of human values is difficult for them. It is sometimes hard to have consideration for others when you can barely survive. For example, it is important to protect the environment, but if someone is hungry, someone may cut down trees or do slate mining so that they can eat. They have to think about the immediate needs of the stomach before environmental concerns. <But here we are talking about one's basic orientation, one's attitudes toward money. We are talking about cases where one doesn't think of money merely as a means to provide one's basic necessities, such as food or shelter. You mentioned thinking of money as a means of achieving freedom. But for many people it even goes beyond that. There's a kind of underlying assumption that money can solve all of our problems.

In those societies the whole focus was geared toward economic development. There was this idea that if economic development is successful, then many of the problems of society will be solved.

In that book I quoted some studies that presented evidence that beyond a certain point, at least beyond the poverty level, or once we have our basic needs met, having more money doesn't bring greater happiness. That was a few years ago. Since then, there have been more studies done looking at the same issue, and at this point the evidence has continued to mount, definitively and conclusively proving that having lots of money doesn't bring more happiness, there is simply no association.

Just the opposite: One is now a slave to money, in even greater bondage than at the beginning. And if one has not examined the underlying assumptions about what money will genuinely supply, then I've noticed that no matter how much money they make, no matter how high their salary is, there is still a kind of nagging worry about not having enough money. This is because the more money they make, the more lavish and expensive their lifestyle becomes, and then of course their expenses increase accordingly. <There can be two main approaches of trying to reduce that worry. The first is to make more money, but as I mentioned, it is questionable whether this will be effective. The second is to reduce one's expenses, to deliberately have more modest desires.

In contrast, those who never lose sight of the purpose of money and have the ability to relate to money with a healthy perspective, even though such people may actually possess less money, will enjoy a greater sense of well-being with regard to wealth and money. So, ironically, they may be poorer in terms of actual material wealth but they are in reality richer, for they are able to understand the true worth of money, and are freed from the unrealistic expectations about what wealth will provide.< Still thinking about the opulent lifestyle of luxury cars and vacation homes of some of my acquaintances, I couldn't help but contrast that with the life of simplicity led by those who lived here in Dharamsala, particularly the community of Buddhist monks and nuns. Thinking about this, I asked, >In the past, you've mentioned the Buddhist concept of 'right livelihood,' a concept that I'd like you to talk more about later. But I'm wondering, is there also a particular Buddhist approach or attitude about money?< I asked. >The Buddhist concept of right livelihood does not have any implications of making any kind of moral judgments upon an affluent lifestyle, or the amount of money one makes. Of course, if an individual is a monk or nun, there are certain restraints coming from the monastic vows, which proscribe the individual from leading a certain life of comfort or life of luxury. For example, strictly speaking, a monk is not supposed to own more than one extra set of robes. So there are certain strictures like that, but if the individual is not a monk and there are no"

So right livelihood has no immediate connotation of simplicity versus luxury. <Among the followers of the Buddha, there were royal members of various kingdoms. I feel that the Buddhist stand on the issue of wealth really has more to do with the mental state of the individual who owns the wealth and who earns it. There is an emphasis on training one's mind so that you will have no sense of possessiveness or miserliness on your part, that you are able to fully transcend any sense of possessiveness. And as for the wealth itself, there are some scriptures where there is an explicit statement that for a bodhisattva, so long as there is a clinging, then even to own or possess a single coin is sinful, is unethical. But if the bodhisattva is free of clinging, then even to own great material resources is not incompatible with the ideal. So this seems to suggest that it is really the state of mind and the means by which you create the wealth that seems to be more important. >In thinking about the Buddhist texts, all the excellences of human existence\u2014such as material affluence and so on\u2014probably from the Buddhist point of view are not something to be discarded. Also in regards to this there is in one of Nagarjuna's texts a discussion of four legitimate human pursuits, two goals and their corresponding means of attainment. One goal is mat"

The second goal is the attainment of liberation, and the means for that is spiritual practice. So, this is the Buddhist view.< The Dalai Lama's position was clear. Our attitudes about money are more important than the amount we make. As always, in our pursuit of happiness, our inner resources assume a greater role than our material resources, unless of course we exist in abject poverty and are suffering from hunger or starvation. We had spoken of those who are >slaves of money,< those for whom pay or salary is the prime consideration in their work. While this is true of many, there are clear signs that this may be changing. In his book Authentic Happiness, Martin Seligman, PhD, one of the key figures in the study of human happiness and the field of positive psychology, states, >Our economy is rapidly changing from a money economy to a satisfaction economy.< He asserts that personal satisfaction is rapidly gaining on financial rewards as the determining factor in many individuals' choice of work. He points out, for instance, that law is now the highest paid profession in America, yet for many, money alone is no longer enough to entice individuals to enter and continue the practice of law. In fact, the major New York law firms now spend more on keeping their staff than on recruitment, as many attorneys are abandoning the practice of law for other kinds of work that may not pay as much but which will make them happier."

I began to question some of the applicants as to why they were considering this job that, in many cases, they were clearly overqualified for. In looking at some of their resumes, I was certain that they could get a higher-paying job. I was surprised by what I heard. Many of the applicants told me that they had turned down positions that would have paid much more, and the responses of many were almost exactly the same as one person who explained, <Money isn't the most important thing to me anymore. I'm more interested in a job that allows flexibility, variety, and time to do other things. I don't want to sit at a desk doing the same thing every day. It will give me the flexibility to pursue my writing and my art. Plus, I like helping people.

With too much challenge, workers experience stress, strain, and deterioration of work performance. With too little challenge, workers become bored, which equally inhibits job satisfaction and hinders performance. In view of the prominent role of challenge or boredom in happiness at work, I raised the issue with the Dalai Lama, explaining, <You know, in talking to my friends as well as looking at the literature on worker satisfaction, it appears that boredom is quite a common source of dissatisfaction at work.> He nodded, commenting, <I think it's quite natural for human beings to become bored if they engage in a repetitive activity.

For example, in Buddhist studies, debate is a very important tool for, progress. We have to spend many hours going through the process of presenting our standpoint, having our views challenged and addressing and responding to these challenges. By engaging opposition, a deeper understanding of one's own standpoint emerges.

Welcoming challenge will help tremendously to sharpen your mind. Without it, the mind will go soft. Isn't it?> I nodded in agreement. On this point there is general accord between East and West: both sides acknowledge the importance of challenge. In fact, as far back as 1776, the political economist and philosopher Adam Smith, a dominant figure in the development of Western capitalism, echoed the sentiments of the Dalai Lama. In his highly influential The Wealth of Nations, he wrote that a person who spends his life engaged in the same repetitive tasks tends to lose <the habit of exertion> and <generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become.> Well, perhaps Mr. Smith was a bit more extreme than the"

Acting with kindness, and even showing affection toward one's enemies, now that's a great challenge! But if one can do that, and eventually even see some positive result, then there will be a tremendous sense of satisfaction and happiness. So, for those who seek to practice compassion, responding to the sufferings of the poor, the weak, the unprotected, and the helpless, these are challenges. Challenge doesn't necessarily mean something that is obstructive or negative. Nor is a task a challenge to a person if he or she doesn't care anything about the matter. For example, the suffering of the poor may not be a challenge for someone who simply does not care. However, for a practitioner of compassion, it certainly is. So, I think there will always be individual differences in what someone may or may not consider to be a challenge, as well as the level of challenge that they prefer. <So,> he concluded, <when you speak of work, I think it is important to keep in mind that there will always be so many different kinds of people, I don't think you can categorically say that challenging work is better or unchallenging work is better.

Summarizing the latest findings of social scientists, Edwin Locke, Dean's Professor Emeritus of Leadership and Motivation at the University of Maryland, College Park, has said, <Research shows consistently that mental challenge\u2014assuming one is willing to respond to the challenge\u2014is a critical determinant of job satisfaction.> Despite the clear-cut link between challenge and work satisfaction, Professor Locke suggests that one's willingness to respond to the challenge is also an important factor. This is where individual variation comes into play as the Dalai Lama rightly points out, there may be individual differences in the degree of challenge that one requires, or is willing to meet. Some may thrive on highly challenging work, while others may be less willing to take on challenging work. So, as we seek to optimize our happiness at work, it is for each one of us to decide what level of challenge provides the greatest degree of growth and satisfaction. As the Dalai Lama reminds us, relating to others with love and affection is a rich source of satisfaction that can seem effortless. In fact, life offers many such moments of satisfaction, moments which can arise spontaneously, effortlessly. This sense of deep fulfillment can occur while we are engaged in many different"

        "content": "Csikszentmihalyi has been investigating and refining this concept. The term <flow> describes a mental state that most of us have experienced at one time or another. To be in flow means to be totally absorbed in whatever one is doing at the moment. It occurs when one is fully present and completely focused on the task at hand. One can be in flow while playing basketball, sculpting, solving a difficult math problem, involved in a business transaction, rock climbing, or simply in a deep conversation with a friend or lover. Essentially, flow can occur during any human activity, whether at work or at play, whether it is primarily a physical, mental, or social activity. While flow can occur under a variety of different circumstances, researchers have found that the specific characteristics of this state are quite uniform and stable: the same characteristic features of this state are present in any given activity or setting. There is also a particular set of conditions that are required to create this state. Flow arises when we are engaged in an activity that we feel is important, meaningful to us, and worth doing. Flow is more likely to occur when there are clear-cut goals to the activity, and we receive some kind of immediate feedback about our progress as the activity unfolds. The task must be challenging and require skills, but there must be just the proper balance between the challenge and our capabilities people in flow feel that their skills are being fully engaged in the task at hand. And even though the project may be challenging and require skills\u2014at that moment it feels effortless. While in flow, we find ourselves engaged in the activity for its own sake alone, not for any external rewards we might receive. The task is intrinsically rewarding, in and of itself."

Challenge is one of the factors required to create this state of flow. This concept is increasingly mentioned in articles on human happiness, and this state can commonly occur at work. Are you familiar with the concept of flow?> <No,> answered the Dalai Lama. <Can you explain to me what you mean by that term?> <Well, briefly, this concept involves a particular state of mind that occurs when our attention is completely focused on a particular task or project that we are doing at the moment. It is a state of intense concentration and deep involvement in the activity. While in flow, one loses a sense of time, it's as if time stops and a person is fully in the present moment, not thinking about the past or future. The person is so immersed in the activity that they even lose a sense of self or identity, the sense of self vanishes, there are no thoughts about 'me,' such as I'm doing this, or I'm feeling that. >Anyway, while engaged in the activity, there's also a feeling of effortlessness, a sense of total control over what one is doing. Take, for example, a professional tennis player. They've practiced and practiced for many years to hone their skills, and now they are in a match with a difficult opponent. They get to a state where all of their skills and all of their learning and capabilities meet the challenge from the opponent and create a kind of balance. Their physical movements and high state of concentration all help to create the state of flow."

The material is very difficult and challenging, yet you've prepared, you've studied, you've developed certain skills, abilities, and knowledge of your field. These conditions could give rise to a state of flow where you're so absorbed in the material that you're not even thinking about how your speech is going, you're not even thinking, I'm the Dalai Lama. You lose all track of time and self-identity.< The Dalai Lama listened attentively. >The kind of mental focus you are referring to where there is a total fusion with one's immediate activity sounds to me like a quality of mind referred to in Buddhist psychology as 'meditative stability.' I believe that each of us can develop the capacity to focus our attention on any chosen object or activity for a prolonged period of time. One of the characteristics of such a focused mind is its total absorption in the chosen activity. In some cases, even disturbances in the immediate environment have no effect in undermining the depth of concentration. I have known individuals who had achieved such states of mind. For example, Gen Nyima-la, one of my earlier teachers, had an amazing capacity for focus.

So, when someone is engaged in work, and they are in the flow state, they get to a point where they are totally absorbed in the work purely for the sake of the work. They are so focused on it, they're not doing the work for money, they're not doing it for fame, they're not doing it to advance their career, they're not even doing it for the benefit of society.

Perhaps that might at least help focus one's mind, and familiarize the person with that kind of concentrated mental state.> The Dalai Lama continued, <Then of course there are other factors that could contribute to the likelihood of achieving that state. For example, you mentioned that the flow state arises when one is engaged in some challenging work or solving some problem, and one's skills and abilities are used to meet that challenge. So it is dependent on one's skills and knowledge of the task at hand. This suggests that one can increase this state by increasing one's familiarity with the particular work or subject.

I don't think it is necessarily associated with happy or positive mental states. I think it can be associated with both happy states or unhappy states. For example, sometimes when you are totally gripped by fear and become paralyzed by the experience, you can experience a loss of time. When I am giving a series of teachings on a text, if I am enjoying the experience of teaching, I tend to lose any sense of time. On the other hand, if I come across points that are extremely difficult and I am struggling with my commentary, then the contrary experience occurs: Here I feel as if time is dragging at a very slow pace. So this phenomenon of loss or distortion of time can occur when one's mind is in a totally relaxed and joyful state, when one is fully concentrated and is delving deeply into a discursive analysis, as well as when one's mind is gripped by more negative emotions such as fear. When this experience occurs, one of the obvious signs is the total obliviousness to the events in the immediate physical surroundings.< He continued, >For example, there could be occasions where you're too scared, almost scared to death, then at that time also you remain totally absorbed and without any sensitivity. So, here one could be in a state where one loses a sense of identity, of time, of place, and so on, one is totally in the moment, but it is not voluntary. It is not due to interest or engagement in some interesting problem or work. It is because of fear, lots of fear, almost as if you are in shock. <I'm wondering\u2014when I fled from my home when the Communist Chinese invaded, I was so frightened that I might have experienced that 'flow' state for a moment.> He laughed. <My"

I had memorized it so well, I had spent the previous few months practicing the recitation daily. So, once I started the prayer it went very fluidly, and because of the training it was automatic.

Now, I have to confess that I'm definitely not an expert in the study of flow, but I would guess, for instance, that if they did a PET scan or EEG and measured the areas of activity in the brain during your recitation when you were in front of thousands of monks and experiencing extreme performance anxiety, and again under different circumstances when you were totally absorbed in some work that put you in the kind of state of flow that I'm talking about, it would be two different things, two different areas of the brain being activated.

What we really need is an ongoing source of satisfaction, of happiness. For example, when we talk about tantric practices of developing great bliss, even those very high states of bliss and ecstasy can't be maintained twenty-four hours a day. So I think this flow state is not reliable or sustainable, and I think it's much more important to develop other sources of satisfaction through one's work that are brought about by training one's mind, shaping one's outlook and attitude, integrating basic human values in the workplace. For example, dealing with one's destructive emotions while at work, reducing anger, jealousy, greed, and so on, and practicing relating to others with kindness, compassion, tolerance, these are much more important and stable sources of satisfaction than simply trying to create 'flow' as much as possible.>"

But the Dalai Lama raises a critical question: As a primary source of happiness and satisfaction at work, how reliable is the flow state? The evening after our conversation about flow, I thought about what the Dalai Lama had said. I suddenly remembered a part of my professor's story that I had conveniently forgotten. After the professor finished describing his experience. I asked him if he had ever experienced that before. <Oh, yes,> he replied, <that same kind of thing has happened to me at least a halfdozen times over the past couple of years.> Clearly, as the Dalai Lama points out, the flow state leaves something to be desired as a primary source of happiness and satisfaction. According to a Gallup poll, around one fifth of American workers report experiencing some degree of flow on a daily basis, with flow defined here as being so completely absorbed in their work that they lose track of time. But more than one third indicated that they rarely or never experience it. These figures are not limited to American workers either, as a German national survey discovered the same ratios among German workers.

As with most other human characteristics, there is considerable individual variation, with some people more prone and some less prone to experiencing flow. When talking about human happiness, whether at work or at play, the Dalai Lama once reminded me that there are different levels and categories of happiness. In one conversation, which was recounted in our previous book, The Art of Happiness, he distinguished between two types of human satisfaction: pleasure and happiness. Pleasure can certainly provide a temporary kind of happiness and engender intense emotional states. He explained that pleasure arises on the basis of sensory experiences, but since it depends on external conditions, it is an unreliable source of happiness. He pointed out, <True happiness relates more to the mind and heart. Happiness that depends mainly on physical pleasure is unstable, one day it's there, the next day it may not be.> To the Dalai Lama, true happiness is associated with a sense of meaning, and arises on the basis of deliberately cultivating certain attitudes and outlooks. One can achieve this type of happiness through a systematic training of the mind. The training involves rooting out destructive states of mind such as hatred, hostility, jealousy, or greed, and deliberately cultivating the opposing mental states of kindness, tolerance, contentment, and compassion. True happiness may take longer to generate, and requires some effort, but it is this lasting happiness that can sustain us even under the most trying conditions of everyday life."

In describing the type of satisfaction or happiness associated with the state of flow, most investigators make a similar distinction between pleasure and happiness, and place flow squarely in the second category. They view pleasure generally as the satisfaction of biological needs, and they distinguish the flow satisfaction by assigning a different label to that kind of happiness, calling it <gratification,> <fulfillment,> or <enjoyment.> For these scientists, the value of flow goes beyond the intrinsic satisfaction of being in that state for a few minutes or a few hours. According to researchers Jeanne Nakamura and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, <Experiencing flow encourages a person to persist at and return to an activity because of the experiential rewards it promises, and thereby fosters the growth of skills over time.> Thus, it is a force that moves us toward growth and achievement of our human potential. But the Dalai Lama takes us one step beyond that. While acknowledging some value to the flow state, he feels that we do not need flow to motivate us toward growth\u2014we can head straight toward the goalpost, and go directly after the happiness we seek. It begins by fully recognizing the supreme importance of the basic human values, which he feels are the source of genuine happiness, whether at work or at home\u2014values like kindness, tolerance, compassion, honesty, forgiveness. Based on our complete conviction about the value of these human qualities, we can then set about training our minds, reshaping our attitudes and outlook.

But he had a talent for teaching. He had a way of connecting with his students, inspiring many to take a genuine interest in chemistry, even though initially many found the subject both too difficult and too boring, a deadly combination. His grad students worshipped him, and he became a mentor to many of them, inspiring and influencing them well beyond the confines of the classroom. I could easily imagine the countless students who, over the course of his forty-year career, were inspired by his kindness, his willingness to help, and the genuine interest he took in the students' careers, even if they were just reluctantly taking chemistry as a prerequisite for another field of study.

For example, in the first year that an individual got a job, it may have been a tremendously joyful event and the accomplishment may have given him or her a sense of fulfillment. But the very same work, if you happen to look at it in the second year, then it may give rise to a totally different response on the part of the individual.> The principle of adaptation suggests that no matter what kind of success or good fortune we experience, or, alternatively, no matter what adversity or tragedy we encounter, sooner or later we tend to adapt to the new conditions and eventually migrate back to our customary levels of day-to-day and momentto- moment happiness. In one study at the University of Illinois, researchers found that within six months after either a misfortune or a happy event, subjects had returned to their usual state of happiness and no residual effects from the event could be found. Thus, you could be promoted to CEO unexpectedly with triple your salary, or you could suddenly experience the most devastating failure at work, yet less than a year later you'll find that you're about as happy as you were before. Of course, there's a reason for this. From a Darwinian perspective, evolutionary psychologists argue that this characteristic has its roots in our remote past as a species. It was an adaptive feature that helped us survive. Thus, if someone was permanently happy from some success or accomplishment, in"

On the other hand, if people were naturally inclined to become permanently depressed or discouraged from a failure or loss, if months and years passed and it continued to hurt every bit as much as it had on the day it happened, again that would be disabling, and would reduce the odds that that individual would survive, pass down their genes, and become an ancestor. This is why, as the Dalai Lama reminds us, we need a balanced life. No matter how satisfying our work is, it is a mistake to rely on work as our only source of satisfaction. Just as humans need a varied diet to supply a variety of needed vitamins and minerals to maintain health, so we need a varied diet of activities that can supply a sense of enjoyment and satisfaction. Recognizing that the principle of adaptation is normal, we can anticipate and prepare for it by intentionally cultivating a full menu of activities that we enjoy. Some experts suggest that one can start by making an inventory\u2014taking a weekend to make a list of the things you enjoy doing, your talents and interests, even new things that you think you might enjoy if you tried them. It may be gardening, cooking, a sport, learning a new language, or volunteer work\u2014any activity through which one can develop and exercise skills. So, if we go through a slow period at work, we can turn to our family, our friends, our hobbies, and other interests as our primary source of satisfaction. And if we shift our interest and attention to other activities for a while, eventually the cycle will swing again, and we can return to our work with renewed interest and enthusiasm."

So, in seeking to gain a sense of fulfillment from one's work, I think one's attitude is the most important thing. Yes Attitude toward one's work is the most important factor.> He paused again. <I think that, and also self-awareness, self-understanding,> he added. <Those are the key things. >But of course, as we discussed, there can be other factors as well. One's emotional make-up, the level of one's emotions such as jealousy, hostility, greed, and so on, can play an important role. For example, if someone gets a job and if the person has a sense of inner contentment and also is not greedy, then to that individual that work may be very fulfilling. On the other hand, there may be a second individual who has the same job but that individual may be much more ambitious and thinks that he deserves a better job than this and this work is too demeaning for him. He's jealous of other colleagues. Then the same work may not give a sense of fulfillment. So of course these kinds of factors make a difference.< There is ample scientific evidence in support of the Dalai Lama's claim that one's underlying attitude affects one's satisfaction and sense of fulfillment at work. Arguably the best research on attitude and general orientation toward work was a 1997 study conducted by Dr. Amy Wrzesniewski (pronounced: rez- NES-kee), an organizational psychologist and professor of business at New York University, and her colleagues, which showed that workers are generally divided into three distinct categories.

Since their prime concern is the wage, if there is a decrease in pay or if a higher-paying job opens up, they are quick to drop the job and move on. The second group of individuals views work as a career. Here, the primary focus is on advancement. Rather than financial motivation, these people are more motivated by prestige, social status, and the power that comes with titles and higher designations at work. In this category, there may be a much greater personal investment in the job, but as soon as the promotions stop, they start to become dissatisfied. Their interest in the job can evaporate, and they may even seek new work. The final category is those who view their work as a calling. These individuals do the work for the sake of the work itself. There is less separation between their job and the other aspects of their life. People in this category tend to love their work, and if they could afford to, they would continue doing the work even if they didn't get paid. They see their work as meaningful, having a higher purpose, making a contribution to society or the world. As one might expect, those who view their work as a calling tend to have significantly higher work satisfaction, as well as overall life satisfaction, than those who view work as a job or career.

With a little reflection and observation, it is easy to discover how one's attitude can have profound effects on enjoyment and satisfaction at work. Of course, our attitudes toward work can be shaped by many factors, both internal and external. Our childhood experiences, upbringing, and culture all may play a role. Like many others in our society, for instance, I remember my father speaking to my siblings and me about the virtues and pleasures of hard work, trying to instill in us the importance of a strong work ethic. And like many in our society, his nonverbal messages created an impression of work that was quite different from his words. Returning home exhausted every evening, and reluctant to talk about his workday, he created some uncertainty in our young minds about exactly what he did on the job. Judging by his demeanor, however, and not having much information to go on, we would not have been surprised if his work somehow involved sitting in a dentist chair getting a root canal from nine to five every day. Based on this, I had no burning desire to enter the workforce. And as a teenager, my first day on a new job did nothing to revise my doubts about the virtues and pleasures of work. I had landed a summer job in a concentrated-orange -juice canning factory. My job involved standing at the end of a conveyor belt, removing boxes of cans and transferring them to a wooden pallet on a metal cart. The learning curve for my fascinating new job lasted approximately eleven seconds. By the end of the first hour, overcome by a mixture of tedium and exhaustion, I already started to resent the boxes as they relentlessly rolled down the"

The plant seemed devoid of humor, and I was beginning to formulate a theory that the factory might be equipped with some kind of special industrial air filter, removing every molecule of fun. My co-worker standing across the conveyor belt seemed to lend some support to my unproven hypothesis. He was completely silent for the first hour on the job, and finally his first words to me were, <This job sucks!> He never told me his name. And to make things worse, he seemed to be deliberately slacking off. He moved so slowly that I was forced to remove and stack more than my share of the boxes. It was infuriating. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, however, maybe it wasn't just him that was moving slowly time was moving so slowly at this new job that perhaps the laws of physics had ceased to exist inside this building. Each minute seemed like an hour, and all I could do was look helplessly at the clock. I didn't think I would make it past the first day. On the second day, however, I received my very first lesson in the prime importance of attitude and how it can completely transform one's experience at work. There was a shift rotation, and my taciturn co-worker was replaced by Carl, an older man who was truly remarkable for his energy and enthusiasm. I couldn't help but marvel at the way he worked.

At some point he had taken the trouble to find out how many cans of orange juice the factory produced, and to which states and countries the juice was shipped. He took pleasure in thinking about where the juice was going and would roar out farcical warnings, like <Careful with that box there boy, the o.j. in that box is goin' directly to Her Majesty's royal yacht, to be mixed with vodka and served up in highball glasses to bored diplomats,> or, <Now, don't drop that, 'cause this orange juice is headed straight for Nebraska, where it's gonna be sucked out of a plastic bottle by a towheaded colicky little one-year-old.> In thinking back to Carl, a man whom I have not thought of in almost thirty years, I came to see him as a classic example of a person who turns routine work into a calling. Continuing with our discussion of attitudes toward work, the Dalai Lama offered an illustration. <When talking about one's attitude toward work, here's one example from my perspective as a monk. I've seen how attitude makes a big difference in how people go about doing their work and in the sense of fulfillment they get from it.

The Dalai Lama nodded his assent. >In terms of identifying attitudes toward work, there was a research study showing that generally speaking, in the West, people view their work in one of three categories: some people view their work simply as a job to earn money, where the wage is the primary interest and motivation, others view their work as a career, and the key point there is focus on career development, advancement, promotions, and going to higher levels in whatever their field is, and then the third category is people who view their work as a calling.

And even with the view of work as a career, that could still potentially lead to dissatisfaction. Of course, it would depend on one's motivation, but if one was only concerned with career advancement, promotions, job titles and designations, there would be a danger of excessive competitiveness, frustration when you don't advance, and jealousy when others advance, and so on. That would not lead to an optimal state of work satisfaction. And there would be further danger of even making enemies.

But the Dalai Lama was right in pointing out that a career orientation with the primary emphasis on promotion, job titles, and designations can potentially be equally a source of misery. Diane serves as an example of the potentially destructive consequences of career orientation associated with an excessive preoccupation with higher status and greater wealth. Diane is a lawyer, a very talented prosecutor. Despite being an eloquent speaker, capable of swaying a tough jury with brilliant arguments and impassioned pleas, when asked why she became a lawyer she is suddenly at a complete loss for words. Perhaps this is because she has always been torn between two opposing views of her work: on one hand seeing her profession as a vehicle to wealth, status, and others' validation of her intelligence, and on the other hand seeing it as a means to protect people from criminals, from the predators who destroy lives and undermine society.

In fact, it grew stronger over the years, fueled by her habit of pouring over alumni bulletins, professional journals, and local newspapers, furiously scanning the pages for reports of the latest achievements of her colleagues. Consumed by competitiveness and jealousy, each award or honor given to another attorney, each promotion to partner, each large jury award in a personal injury suit (of course calculating to the penny the 30 percent fee received by her colleague), was like a blow to her. The cumulative effect resulted in years of misery, and a growing bitterness which eventually eroded her relationships with friends and family. Diane's steadfast refusal to let go of her endless quest for riches and fame in the private sector is particularly sad in view of her tremendous talent and abilities as a prosecutor. It has led her to continually turn down offers from the attorney general's office to return in a higher-ranking position and with much more visibility.

But it is not the case that there is a division based on the job. In fact, the very same study that identified the three primary categories of how we view work found that there was the same division, no matter what the particular field or job. They studied a group of college administrators all with the same job, same level of education, same setting, and so on, and they found that a third saw their work as a job, a third as a career, and a third as a calling. So, even among nurses, physicians, or social workers, some just see it as a job, some see it as a career, focusing on more promotions or advancement, and some people see it as a calling.

An individual worker on an assembly line somewhere may not directly see the benefit of his or her hard labor, but through a little analysis they can realize the indirect benefits to others and be proud of what they do, and have a sense of accomplishment. Workers all over the world are bringing happiness to others, even though they may not see this. I think that often if one works for a large company, on the surface it may appear that one's job is insignificant, that an individual worker doesn't have much impact directly on the big company. But if we investigate deeper, we may realize that our jobs can have indirect effects on people we may never even meet. I think that in a small way, perhaps through our work, we can make some contribution to others. <Now, others, for instance, may be working for the government in some way, and thus see working for their country as the higher purpose. For example, in the 1950s there were many Chinese, including soldiers, who genuinely felt that they were working for the benefit of others, at least for the benefit of the Party, and that meant the benefit of the people. So they had a strong conviction of their purpose, and even sacrificed their lives. And they didn't care about personal gains. Similarly, in the monastic world there are many individual monks who choose to live in seclusion as hermits in the mountains, under basic conditions and great hardships. They have the option to remain in the monastery and have a life of greater comfort and ease. But because they have a much higher purpose in their mind, because their goal is to achieve liberation so that they"

I think these people enjoy a certain mental satisfaction from their work.< The Dalai Lama sipped his tea as he reflected. >There is always a way to find a higher purpose to one's work. Of course, there may be some individuals who may not need to work because of their special financial circumstances. Under such circumstances, they can enjoy their freedom and enjoy the privilege they have, and that's one thing. But among those who need to work to make a living, then it is important for these individuals to recognize that, first of all, they are part of a society. They are members of the human society that they are living in. And also, they should recognize that by actively participating in this workforce, in some way they are acting out their role as a good citizen in their society, a productive member of society. And in this way, they can realize that indirectly they are making a contribution to the entire society. So if they think along these lines, then they can see some purpose in what they are doing that is beyond just providing a means of livelihood for themselves. That alone can be enough to give them a sense of purpose, a sense of calling. And this idea can be reinforced if they simply ask themselves, What is the other alternative? Just hanging around. Then there is the danger of drifting into some unhealthy habits, such as resorting to drugs, being part of a gang, or acting as a destructive member of society. So, there, not only are you not contributing to the society that you live in, but in fact you are undermining the very stability of the society that you are part of. If any worker thinks along those lines, they will see a higher purpose to their work.< The Dalai Lama paused again and laughed. >I'm thinking that"

No matter what kind of job we have, with some attention and effort we can find greater meaning in our work. Dr. Amy Wrzesniewski, a leading investigator in the study of worker satisfaction, has said, >Recent research has shown that people in menial jobs can transform their relations to their work and do so by shaping the tasks and relationships that are part of the job in ways that make the work more meaningful.< There can be many ways that a given individual can make work more meaningful. One woman, who works in a clerical position for a major corporation, described how she does this: >Every day I pick out just one person who looks like they are having a peanut butter sandwich day, and I just make an effort to give them a word of encouragement, ask them if I can help in some way, or sometimes it's just giving them a smile and a pat on the back.

So when I'm feeling like that, I don't try to do a wholesale shift in attitude\u2014telling myself, 'O.K., my job ultimately results in people being helped.' That doesn't work. I have to start small. I have to start with the irritation I feel when I have to answer a nagging question from a co-worker. I have to appreciate that person as someone who also has a job to do and whose needs are at least as important, if not more so, than my own. Then I can take some satisfaction in the fact that because of my job I've been able to help clear someone else's confusion. From there, I can turn to the task at hand of, say, writing a marketing memo to position a book. Then I can think about how people in-house are reacting to that book\u2014that it was comforting to them to read, that it was perfect for a loved one who was in the hospital and could they have another copy to send to their father? Then I think about the thousands of copies that will be in bookstores around the world and the people who might go in and buy the book, read it, feel helped, and pass the book along to someone else who might feel helped, and so on.

It's a mind-training exercise that I have to engage in all the time.

He has the skills to advance, and he should advance.

So here he has an inflated image of himself, he does not have accurate self-understanding.

In Buddhist psychology, there is great emphasis placed on the importance of having a sense of self that is grounded in reality. This is because there is an intimate connection between how we see ourselves and how we tend to relate to others and the world. Needless to say, how we see ourselves also affects how we tend to react to a given situation. Now, on a very basic level, human beings have an innate sense of self, a sense of 'I,' that we perceive to be a kind of fixed, unchanging inner core, something that is independent, separate from others and the world. The question becomes, however, whether this sense of self, this T that we cling to so strongly, truly exists in the way that we perceive it to exist. What is the true underlying nature of the self? What is the ultimate basis of the self? That becomes a critical issue in Buddhist thought, because we assert that this belief in a unitary, solid, unchanging T is at the root of all of our mental and emotional afflictions, the destructive mental states that obstruct our happiness. Using reason, logic, and careful analysis, in searching for the ultimate nature of the self, we find that there is a gap between how we appear to exist and how we truly exist. A gap between appearance and reality. But this kind of investigation into the ultimate nature of the self, the nature of reality, is a matter of Buddhist theory and practice. It has to do with what is referred to in Buddhist language as emptiness or no-self. This is a separate issue from the kind of self-understanding that we are discussing here. Here, we are concerned primarily with self-understanding in the conventional sense. So we are"

How does one begin to do that?< I asked. >Now, if you are talking about one's work or job,< the Dalai Lama suggested, >if people wish to have a greater understanding about the level of their knowledge or technical skills in their particular field or profession, then they may want to voluntarily take certain tests that may help them find that out. I think that would help increase one's understanding of what one's capabilities are, at least on the level of technical skills, proficiency, or the type of knowledge that can be objectively measured. <But if we are talking about increasing self-awareness and understanding on a deeper level, then the main thing is to have a view of self that is grounded in reality. Here, the goal is to have an undistorted view of oneself, an accurate appraisal of one's abilities and characteristics.> I considered this for a moment. Once again, I was struck by how the Dalai Lama's views, an amalgam of Buddhist wisdom and common sense, so closely parallel the findings of Western science. <You know, what you're saying reminds me of some of the recent theories advanced by certain researchers and experts in the science of human happiness. One researcher in particular, Martin Seligman, talks about increasing self-understanding by identifying what he calls one's signature strengths'\u2014one's natural good qualities and characteristics, the unique set of virtuous traits that each one of us possesses.

He identified six main categories of human virtue, such as wisdom, courage, and love. He then subdivided these primary virtues into twenty-four 'signature strengths.' For example, Courage is subdivided into Valor, Perseverance, and Integrity. Anyway, this investigator maintains that one can become happier at work by identifying one's signature strengths and making a conscious effort to use these strengths on the job\u2014every day if possible. He recommends choosing work where you can naturally use these strengths. But if you can't do that, then he suggests recrafting your present job to use these strengths as much as possible.< I continued, >Earlier, we talked about how people are happier at work if they view their work as a calling. We spoke about how one way to do that was by reshaping one's attitude and trying to discover a higher purpose or meaning to one's work. According to Seligman, there's another way to transform work into a calling\u2014by identifying and using one's signature strengths. So in a way, I think this relates to the idea of self-understanding that you are talking about. At least on a conventional level. <Talking about using one's signature strengths at work, I think you may be a good example of that. I remember that we've spoken in the past about your role as leader of the Tibetan people, and the degree of success that you've had.

This kind of attitude may sometimes provide a sense of protection, when in actual fact it closes the door to any real awareness of one's own possible shortcomings. Excessive pride, which often leads to an inflated sense of self-importance, will also obstruct the possibilities for greater self-understanding. For example, when you are arrogant, you are less likely to be open to other people's suggestions and criticisms, which are crucial for developing greater self-understanding. Furthermore, an inflated sense of self leads one to have unrealistic expectations of oneself, which has the consequence of putting excessive pressure on oneself. When these expectations are not fulfilled, which often is the case, this then becomes a source of perpetual dissatisfaction.< I asked, >So how does one overcome that kind of exaggerated sense of one's abilities?< >The first requirement is that people actually want to overcome this. So here they could spend time thinking about the ways that this has caused them problems and suffering. Understanding the damaging effects of arrogance will increase their willingness to overcome it.

That is because this realistic view gives one a certain sense of self-confidence, a certain inner strength. They know what they are truly capable of, and also what their limitations are. And so they are less affected by what other people say. So if they are criticized, and it is valid criticism, they can accept this more easily and use it as an opportunity to learn something about themselves. Whereas, if they are falsely accused, they do not react so strongly because deep inside they know that it is not true, they know themselves.

His concept of self-awareness, however, goes beyond merely knowing what one's particular skills or talents are. To him, self-understanding requires the elements of honesty and courage in addition to self-examination\u2014it involves coming to an accurate assessment of who one is, to see reality clearly, without exaggeration or distortion. The benefits of accurate self-appraisal are clear. In a 2002 study led by Barry Goldman, PhD, JD, professor of management and policy at the University of Arizona, people with a strong sense of their own identity not only had greater work satisfaction, but also higher levels of personal well-being and overall life satisfaction. The study by Goldman and his colleagues defined personal identity as >a psychological state reflecting self-knowledge and a firm consistent sense of personal values and of one's ability to sustain one's conclusions in the face of opposition from others.< Thus, greater self-knowledge was associated with confidence in one's own judgment, which suggests that one may be less affected by others' unwarranted criticism and may rely less on others' praise to supply a sense of self-worth. Further, researchers have found that in addition to having greater work and life satisfaction, those with a strong sense of identity may even enjoy other benefits, such as having fewer marital disputes."

In my own case, for instance, these destructive effects have been made readily apparent not only in my past professional life as a psychotherapist, but also in my personal life among my friends and acquaintances. Low self-esteem and underestimating one's abilities can be paralyzing, stifling personal initiative and inhibiting the individual from exploring new opportunities. Ultimately, it can obstruct the realization of one's full potential, preventing the achievement of one's goals. Inflated self-image can be equally devastating, as the individual is constantly at odds with a world that refuses to see them as they see themselves\u2014at the center of the universe, an unappreciated genius in a world of morons. In many ways, however, low self-esteem is easier to overcome than inflated self-image. Those with low self-esteem suffer from a tendency to blame themselves for everything, so at least they often recognize that they have a problem that needs to be addressed. They are much more likely to seek professional help to overcome their low self-esteem or associated disorders like depression, which are sometimes also present. Those on the opposite end of the spectrum, however, those with an exaggerated sense of their accomplishments and talents, tend to blame the world for their problems.

Once one recognizes the destructive nature of arrogance, how can one distinguish between that and healthy self-confidence? In one conversation that led to our first book, The Art oj Happiness: A Handbook for Living, I once asked the Dalai Lama how individuals could tell if they were being arrogant or merely self-confident. He replied that those with self-confidence have a valid basis for their confidence, they have the skills and abilities to back it up, whereas arrogant people are not grounded in reality\u2014they have no valid basis for their inflated opinion of themselves. I reminded the Dalai Lama that this would not be a helpful distinction for arrogant people, since they always feel they have a valid basis for their opinion of themselves. Acknowledging the difficulty in distinguishing between confidence and arrogance, the Dalai Lama finally shrugged his shoulders, laughed, and joked, <Maybe the person should go to the court to find out if it is a case of arrogance or confidence!> Moments later, however, he settled down and observed that sometimes one could determine this only in retrospect, by looking at the results of one's actions, whether they ultimately resulted in benefit or harm to oneself or others. The first step in overcoming arrogance and inflated self-image is recognizing how damaging they are, and for that sometimes we need to analyze the outcome or results of our attitudes and actions.

After my talk, Fred, a lanky, wellgroomed man in his mid-forties, cornered me as I was leaving, asking for my advice. With a kind of professorial air and superior manner, he introduced himself as a friend of a friend of mine. He began by reciting his academic credentials, which were fairly impressive. He apparently had showed academic promise as a brilliant young student, graduating with a 4.0 average from a prestigious university at the age of nineteen. While up to this point in his life he had failed to fully live up to his early potential, he was quick to point out that he felt he was capable of great literary achievements. Explaining to me that he had a wonderful idea for a book based on some research he had done in graduate school, he abruptly and unceremoniously pulled out a large stack of loose papers from his briefcase, stating that this was a portion of the material he was planning on including in his book. Within minutes he had asked me not only to read and critique his writing but also asked if there was anything I could do to help him find an agent or publisher. I explained that I certainly wished him well but that my schedule was too busy right then to agree to his request. Besides, I went on, there were a lot of people out there, English professors or professional editors, who were much more qualified than I to critique his writing."

I finished by offering words of encouragement, but stressing the importance of persistence\u2014the key to success, in my view. I described how in my own case, The Art oj Happiness was rejected by dozens of agents and publishers over a period of several years, and expressed how difficult it was for a first-time author to get published.

Over the next several weeks, having gotten my home phone number from my friend under some pretext, he called me several times at inconvenient hours, engaging me in long conversations about his ideas for the book.

That concept was completely foreign to traditional Tibetan society. Of course, I'm not talking about the many modern Tibetans who live in the West or in urban settings. But in traditional Tibetan society, people were mostly farmers, animal herders, or merchants. The idea of set hours of work simply did not exist. In the West, economic conditions and societal structures are such that this kind of employment is an integral part of the concept of work. <Among Tibetans, at least traditionally, the economic conditions are such that this nine-to-five daily employment isn't really an important part of it. In Tibet, either you are a farmer or a nomad or you are a merchant. The work is seasonal. Since this pattern is what they are accustomed to, it is seen as natural. So, if you look at the people living here in McLeod Ganj, a lot of them now own shops, and many of them do a traditional kind of seasonal merchant business in Indian towns.

This way, we won't become so upset by taking it personally, or looking around us for someone to blame for our problems. This alone may help reduce our mental agitation.

In fact, the root of the Sanskrit word karma means >action.< And just as one's past actions may have contributed to one's current circumstances, one's present actions can change one's future.

This has to do with one's self-image. Some people identify so strongly with their role at work, their self-concept is so mixed with the role they play or sometimes the amount of money they make, that it is as if they don't exist once they lose their job. Those are people whose value system places the greatest emphasis on money or status or those kinds of things, rather than inner values, basic good human qualities. So, for example, I've known some Indian and Tibetan officials over the years and have had an opportunity to observe how they respond differently to job loss and in particular to retirement. Among these officials, some have had their self-identity based primarily on their position, and would take a kind of refuge in their title. In many cases, these officials would bully their subordinates and generally revel in their power and position, or misuse their power. On the other hand, I've known other officials who seem to base their self-identity more on basic human qualities and characteristics, identifying with just being a good person, an honest person, a humble person, and they would treat their subordinates accordingly.

So, different people seem to respond to the same circumstances and situations very differently.< >I know exactly what you mean,< I said. >When I used to practice individual psychotherapy, I encountered patients who lost their jobs, or who retired, and it could lead to severe clinical depression. I've seen powerful CEOs who lost their jobs, and if their identity was based primarily on work, it was like they became a living ghost. So,< I asked, >if you were going to advise people, what would you tell them, what would be your advice to those who very strongly identify with the job that they have?< >I'd advise them that they were incredibly foolish and stupid!< He laughed. >There's not much else to say, unless people are really willing to change their basic attitude. But the wise way to avoid, perhaps not the problem of job loss, but at least the mental agitation that may go with it, in this case, is to widen one's self-image, see oneself first as a human being with the capacity for friendships, for kindness, and so on, and then realize that one has different roles in addition to the role at work\u2014one may be a parent or a child or a brother or sister, one may have other interests or hobbies.

No. Human life isn't just for work, like this communist vision where everyone's purpose is just to work for the state, and there is no individual freedom, where the state even arranges the person's vacations and everything is planned out for the individual. That is not a full human life. Individuality is very important for a full human life, and then accordingly some leisure time, a bit of holiday, and time spent with family or friends. That is the means to a complete form of life.

He was an expensively dressed, distinguishedlooking man, appearing much younger than his seventy-two years, but his unshaven and unkempt condition left a distinct, unmistakable stamp of depression on his countenance. Speaking in a low monotone voice, he described how, starting at the bottom, he had built a hugely successful media corporation, but he had recently decided to quit. His company had been sold to a large multinational conglomerate a few years before, and while he had made a fortune from the sale, he had also requested to stay on as CEO to run the company. But after a couple of years, he became increasingly disenfranchised as major decisions were gradually taken out of his hands. Finally, the parent company made an acquisition that he felt <impinged on the bottom line of my division,> and feeling his status and power slipping away, he decided to quit. This man's diagnosis was clear and straightforward, and it was easy to identify the significant <psychosocial stressor> that had triggered his major depression: the loss of his role at work had been an assault to his self-identity.

He had been actively involved in a number of charitable organizations, still sitting on the advisory board of more than one, and until the depression caused him to curtail his customary pursuits, he had been highly motivated in his involvement. He had even taken a part-time teaching post at a prestigious university. After several sessions, however, it became obvious that the therapeutic intervention wasn't going to be as easy as I had initially anticipated. Session after session he continued to indulge in nonstop rumination and complaints about his former colleagues and the poor state of his industry. He continued to focus solely on his former position, to the exclusion of the other aspects of his life. It was apparent that I had underestimated the degree to which his self-identity was tied to his job and the status and power that went with it.

Fortunately, however, there is still hope for most of us, particularly if we start ahead of time and don't wait until the end of our career to cultivate a wider sense of who we are. All it takes is willingness, attention, and a bit of effort, and each one of us has the capacity to develop stategies to expand our self-identity beyond the workplace. Not long ago, a friend of mine, Lena, described a method she has been using for some time to overcome her fear of job loss and help to extricate her personal identity from her role at work. <I got to a point in my career where my whole life revolved around my job. I was up when things were good and down when things were bad at work, and my social life took a backseat. As I progressed, and got promoted a bunch of times, things became more competitive and if you lose a job at that level, it's much harder to find a comparable one. I found myself having difficulties sleeping and becoming short-tempered because I was so worried about losing my career. I was having full-blown anxiety attacks over it. I had lost myself, and something needed to be done. I needed a way to unhook my identity from my work. So I began to rehearse every day in my mind what my life would look and feel like if I were fired. I visualized what the meeting with my boss would be like when I got canned, and thought about how my colleagues would treat me afterward (like I had the plague, I'm sure), whether people would remain my friend or drop me like a hot potato once I had lost my high-status job. >I would think about what it would be like to find another job, and what it would be like if I were shut out of my industry"

But it's worthwhile to remember what's worthwhile, and like Lena we may need to remind ourselves of this consistently, before we end up investing our whole identity and purpose for living in our role at work. Some might consider tenured college professors or U.S. Supreme Court Justices to be nature's final word in job security, but compared to the Dalai Lama these individuals are hanging on to their jobs by a thread. Not only is he assured of his position as Dalai Lama throughout his lifetime, but he is guaranteed the same job in numberless future lifetimes as well. That's job security.

But to my surprise, he seemed to take the question very seriously. In fact, the expression on his face was uncharacteristically grave (well, almost grave), as he nodded thoughtfully and replied, >Yes now, just recently in fact I was reading a Tibetan text by a great Buddhist master who lived in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and in this text he was giving advice to his students. He told them that it is important for them to understand what is the true essence of spirituality. He advised them that, recognizing the true essence of Buddhist practice, they should not get caught up in the external forms of practice like reciting mantras, making circumambulations, making prostrations, and so on. Of course, these are aspects of Buddhist spiritual practice, but they are not the core. The core of Buddhist practice really is to bring about inner transformation, through spiritual training of the mind. And I think one can still practice the essence, the core, even without the external forms. <This author then went on to encourage those students with the greatest capabilities, those who hold the highest spiritual ideals, to live as hermits in the wilderness, in solitude. He cited extensively from the very inspirational 'songs of experience' written by Milarepa.

Much time has passed. And also with this title of Dalai Lama I have many responsibilities. And I thought that even if I were to choose that kind of life, living in solitude, I don't know if I would have the skills to cook for myself, even make myself a cup of tea.> He chuckled. <And on top of that I thought about many practical considerations, questions of security, what I would do if someone came to harm me. So all of these things would make it harder for me to live as a hermit at this point in my life.> The Dalai Lama was perfectly still for several moments, lost in his private thoughts, maybe pondering the course of his life, I don't know. But he soon roused himself from his reverie and added, <Anyway, if I had been younger and my situation in life had been different, that is what I would have liked to do. Your question reminded me of these things. And to answer your question about choosing an alternative kind of job or life if my situation was different, living in solitude as a hermit is the only thing that comes to mind.

After all, even ignoring his position as the world's only Dalai Lama, few of us are monks, and fewer still would consider being a hermit as the only alternative to their present employment. Reviewing our conversation in my mind later on, however, I was less certain about the lack of relevance of his thoughts to the rest of us. A key idea emerged: distilling the essence of one's particular role or activity, and binding one's identity to the essence rather than the outer trappings of one's position. In the Dalai Lama's case, the work of a monk is spiritual practice. The external activities or duties of this job involved certain rituals, recitations, a certain manner of dress and behavior. The essence involved inner development. He made it clear that even if he had to relinquish the external forms, he could still be happy by retreating into solitude and continuing to practice the essence. Perhaps this was something that could be applied to others after all. The earlier example of Lena illustrated how a person can discover techniques to expand one's self-concept beyond the confines of the workplace. In her case, she found that visualization and mental rehearsal of her worst fears coming true, along with deliberate reflection on the various roles she played in life, her non-work-related roles, was an effective strategy to divest her self-identity from her job. But in regard to discovering effective strategies, it seems that the Dalai Lama added another dimension, taking a quantum leap, in fact. In a sense one could conceptualize Lena's technique as widening one's self-image by <outward expansion> looking out across the landscape of her life to find other parts of herself beyond the workplace.

The Dalai Lama's method, on the other hand, involves widening one's identity by a kind of <inward expansion>\u2014going to the core, moving to a deeper and more fundamental level by discovering the essence of the particular role or activity From this perspective, then, the essence of one's role as a spouse, parent, or friend is human love and affection. The essence of one's hobbies, such as studying a new language or learning new cooking recipes, could be the love of learning. The essence of other interests, such as painting or sculpting, might be an appreciation of beauty. Or the essence of athletic pursuits, such as golf or basketball, might be the exercise of skills or cultivation of good health. In this sense, the essence of one's job might be to assure survival, of course, but it may also involve making a meaningful contribution to others or to society in some way. It would seem reasonable that basing one's identity on the essence rather than the external form would decrease the likelihood that one would be devastated by the loss of any particular role or job after all, the essence is portable and can be transferred to any activity, any given relationship, hobby, or job. Yes, the more I thought about it, the more this seemed to be a sensible approach to preventing the destructive consequences of investing too much of one's identity in one's job. Still, I wasn't entirely certain about how effective this method might be or how easily it could be done. I guess I'll have to give it some more thought. Perhaps give it a try myself."

But what I'm wondering is, from your personal perspective or perhaps from a Buddhist perspective, are there other considerations besides things like salary or one's personal strengths that a person should take into account when choosing a job, to assure a deeper or more long-term happiness at work?< >Oh, yes,< he responded immediately. >It may be difficult to apply to everybody, but one factor that would be very useful to consider is the benefit or harm caused by the work that one does. Now, from a Buddhist perspective, we talk about the concept of 'right livelihood.' The Buddhist concept of right livelihood means that you strive to engage in an activity that has no potential for being harmful to others, either directly or indirectly. The wrong means of livelihood is often described as any means of livelihood that involves exploitation of others out of negative motives, such as deceitfulness and guile. In wrong livelihood, you grab things to which you have no particular right. You take things from others. From a layperson's perspective, if the livelihood that he or she engages in has no direct or"

What the Buddha seems to have emphasized is ensuring that when you seek your livelihood, you do so in an ethical way, you don't harm others, you don't damage others, and you don't act with deception or guile. He seemed to be more concerned about the way in which you go about making a living rather than how much money you make.< >You mention the importance of assessing the potential benefit or harm of the kind of work you do,< I recapped, then added another twist. >Now, the other day you mentioned that one means of turning your work into a calling was to analyze the broader contribution of your job. Let's say an individual is getting bored and they decide that they are going to systematically review the broader implications of their work. Instead of just sitting on an assembly line, pushing a button all day, they start to contemplate what their actions contribute to society so that they can feel more enthusiastic about their job again, feel better about it. So they start analyzing, but then they discover that the type of work they are doing is ultimately harmful for the environment. Or let's say they make a part that is used for weapons. Once they think about it, they realize that it is not productive\u2014in fact, it's destructive in some way. And yet at the same time, maybe they don't have a lot of resources\u2014they can't just quit their job and look for a better job because they have a family to support and there aren't many other industries in their area. I'm wondering if you could address that issue in view of your definition of 'right livelihood.'< The Dalai Lama was quiet, instinctively running his hand over his shaven head as he turned the dilemma over in his mind."

But at the same time if you look at the picture from the vantage point of overall society, unless there is a fundamental change in the society as a whole, for defense purposes for the society, or even on the global level, nations do need weapons for security purposes. Especially in the American case, you look at the fact that in the world there are totalitarian regimes who are against democracy.

O.K. But this is a case where a person may already have some employment but later discover that the job might indirectly cause harm. So there you need to take it on a case-by-case basis, and take into account all the variables, the nature and the degree of the harm, the person's values, and so on.

Are Eastern or Asian attitudes different from Western attitudes?

But having said that, of course, just as there are individual differences, there may be local, national, regional, and cultural differences in people's attitudes toward work. This may affect satisfaction with one's job.

This is because that kind of work is not seen as so demeaning in America, so this shows how the surrounding culture can affect satisfaction with one's job.< >Well, I'm not sure about that lack of bias against certain jobs in America,< I said. >I think even in the States, there are cultural attitudes and biases against certain types of work. To a large extent, you're judged based on the status of your job.< >But it is much worse in India,< he contended. >There is much more bias against that kind of work. And I think in America, in that kind of capitalist society, one is judged more on the amount of money one makes rather than the precise nature of the job itself. So, if dishwashers normally made large amounts of money, it would not be considered demeaning. Money is the determining factor. In India or other countries, there may be a bias against the nature of the work itself, being in a serving position. I think the emphasis on freedom and equality in America reduces the prejudice against those kinds of jobs to some extent, as long as it is honest work. So there, it is the human being that is more important than the job. For example, when I went to see former President Jimmy Carter at his home, apart from one guard outside, inside he was very simple, very down to earth, he was doing his own household things, cooking and all the others.

So it is a cultural attitude. <And I think even within the same region, within Asia, for instance, you can see cultural differences. Japanese, Chinese, or Tibetan attitudes toward work may all be different. For example, nowadays inside Tibet, you can see differences between Chinese attitudes and Tibetan attitudes. The Chinese seem more preoccupied with money, whereas a Tibetan may take money for his services, but may also accept some chang or other things in payment. Take a Chinese tailor and a Tibetan tailor. Both have to make money to live, but you might see the Chinese tailor working day and night, trying to make money, money money. But I think generally among Tibetans, money isn't as important. They may sacrifice earning more money so they can have more leisure time, time with their family, and so on. Of course, the Chinese worker might become rich, but even though they may not become rich the Tibetans don't seem to have much enthusiasm for sacrificing their time with family and other things just to make more money.

On the other hand, in a colder climate, under harsher conditions, where survival is more difficult, this may have eventually given rise to cultures that placed much greater emphasis on hard work. In those northern climates and under those conditions, they had to find new ways to help survival, so they may have developed sea routes, and eventually industry, science, technology, and these things.

They lay their eggs on the shores and apparently there was again a government policy that during the egg-laying season, they would appoint people to watch over the eggs to make sure they were safe.

There is no denying the fact that those who engage in work that deliberately harms others may enjoy some temporary feelings of satisfaction. But from the Dalai Lama's viewpoint, the states of mind that lead to destructive activities or harmful kinds of work, states of mind such as unbridled greed, hostility, anger, or even hatred, are simply incompatible with a person's long-term happiness. Of course, the example of criminal pursuits or genocidal maniacs is the most extreme case, and as the Dalai Lama often points out, life is complex, and thus there may be varying degrees of harm or benefit that result from one's work, sometimes very subtle. But in assuring our long-term happiness, we can begin by cultivating some awareness of the impact of our work upon others. Over the years, I've noticed that sometimes the Dalai Lama is asked to boil his philosophy down to a single fundamental principle. To this difficult question, he often replies, <If you can, serve others. If not, at least refrain from harming them.> If we can do that on the job, we're well on our way toward happiness at work."

It's not actually solving the problem. Some people may spend many years doing these practices, but their actual progress is zero. That's not productive meditation. Genuine progress occurs when the individual not only sees some results in achieving higher levels of meditative states but also when their meditation has at least some influence on how they interact with others, some impact from that meditation in their daily life\u2014more patience, less irritation, more compassion. That's productive meditation. Something that can bring benefit to others in some way.< Finally, a picture began to emerge. I said, >So it seems that your definition of productive activity, if I'm understanding correctly, is an activity that has a positive goal.< Once again, the Dalai Lama was quiet for a long while as he contemplated the matter. >From my personal point of view, yes. And not only a positive goal, but even if you have a positive goal, if your activity doesn't actually benefit anybody, I don't know whether or not that can be categorized as productive or not. For example, a person can study a lot. Read, read, read. Now, you may be reading an awful lot of pages, but if it doesn't produce anything or bring any benefit, then it is just a waste of your time. Of course, although that should be the general meaning of productivity, it still depends on the context. But generally speaking, if your activity or work can clearly benefit someone, I would classify that as productive. So, briefly put, I believe that a productive activity must be purposeful in that it is directed toward a specific goal. In addition, it must be an activ"

Normally, production is equated with that kind of result. And second, many people think it may imply some positive thing. I think even in the conventional use of the word 'productive,' there is often a sense that there is a positive purpose\u2014saying that someone is not being a productive person has a negative connotation. But then again, it is not always the case that some positive purpose or goal is implied in the use of the word. For example, one can talk of producing poison\u2014it is productive, but it is negative. So there can be destructive actions, destructive work\u2014it's called work and in one sense that too may be considered productive. Destructive work involves movement, movement toward something, creating new things. So in that sense it's productive, productive in the sense that it simply produces something. >So generally I think the word 'productive' might be neutral, like 'work,' it can be either positive or negative. It is similar to the word 'freedom,' for example. I think freedom itself is not necessarily positive. You can be free to do negative things. Isn't it? But usually I think it is taken for granted that freedom is something good. So similarly, strictly speaking, productive is neutral: it can be either destructive or constructive, positive or negative, but usually we take it for granted that 'productive' is something that is not harmful. Maybe, but I don't know I"

There are serious questions about the production of things like weapons or poisonous products. Of course, the employees who produce these things get a salary, sometimes quite a high salary, but if we characterize these activities as productive, we have to be aware of what sense of productivity we are using here. So again, we see the complicated nature of this issue. Say, for example, all the Nazi activity of genocide, which involved detailed planning, strategy, and implementation, we cannot say that these activities are productive. Similarly, criminals may be working hard but we would not want to characterize their work as productive either. So all of this suggests to my mind that in our conception of what is a productive activity, the concept of nonharmfulness, if not actual benefit to others, is somehow implied. Compared to these criminal activities, even if spiritual practices such as engaging in meditation may not have immediate material results, at least such activities are harmless, and so may be considered more productive. So, I don't know, conventionally speaking perhaps we can define productive work as an activity that entails production of something, either material or spiritual, that others can utilize and, through this, derive benefits from the activities that lead to its production. I don't know.> He suddenly started to laugh. <You know, we keep looking at different angles and different aspects of this idea of productive activity\u2014productive, unproductive, positive, negative, various kinds and definitions of productive work, depending on one's"

But in fact I think the conversation may have had some benefit and made things clearer for me, because it changed my thinking in one regard. You asked me if I thought that meditating would be considered productive activity. From the conventional Western perspective, my initial response was no, but while you were talking I think I changed my mind. I want to recant my statement. Now I'm thinking that in view of your definition of productive meditation, where the meditative states are brought into the world, at the very least in how we interact with others, I think it would be considered a productive activity because the monks or meditators were learning, they were developing their minds, training their minds, and making positive changes. And in that sense they were making progress and accomplishing goals, so I think it would be considered productive. <Anyway, I think we have come to an understanding. Even though different people may have different concepts of what they consider productive work to be, for the purposes of our discussions, I'd like to stick with your concept\u2014that productive work involves being engaged in an activity that is associated not only with accomplishing something, some kind of goaldirected activity, but also that activity has to have some kind of positive purpose.> He nodded his head. <Agreed.>"

But simply taking a few moments to think about the definition of the word brought up an important point. As the Dalai Lama suggested, the term was essentially neutral\u2014one could produce instruments of torture or one could produce a life-saving medicine\u2014 strictly speaking both would be considered productive activity. But from the Dalai Lama's perspective, a view of life that focuses on our quest for happiness, the mere production of goods or services is not enough to assure our ultimate happiness. For that to occur, one must add an additional element we must also consider the results of our labor, the effect it will have on ourselves, our family, society, and the world. As we acknowledged in our discussion of <right livelihood,> although it is not always easy, nor even always possible, we must do our best to assure that our work brings some benefit to others. For the Dalai Lama, that is the surest way to forge an unbreakable bond between our work and the deep and lasting happiness that we all seek. For some who may consider redefining their concept of <productive labor,> adopting the Dalai Lama's definition, there may be some danger involved. A cigarette salesperson, for instance,"

But paradoxically, embracing this new definition of productive labor may actually expand our concept of productivity and open us to many new possibilities, many new sources of satisfaction at work. Changing our concept of productive labor can have some interesting consequences. Now, if we sell software and may have had an unproductive day in terms of not having had a single sale, we can still have a sense of accomplishment if we have had some positive interactions with our customers or co-workers, if we've made their day just a little bit better.

Of course, as with most other facets of human behavior, evolutionary psychologists advance their own theory of why human beings have the natural capacity to derive pleasure and satisfaction from hard work: On the savannas and plains of a primordial land in the distant past, there once roamed a small band of early humans. Among this hand of prehistoric hunter-gatherers there were two brothers, Jim and Lemarr. Having common parentage and common characteristics as human beings, the brothers were similar in many ways. Both enjoyed scjuatting by a warm fire on a chilly night, enjoying a tasty haunch of antelope. But like all humans, there were subtle differences in their genetic make-up resulting in slight variations, not only in appearance, but also in intelligence, temperament, and disposition. Lemarr enjoyed making things, developing and exercising skills, and gained a sense of enjoyment and satisfaction from spending long hours engrossed in fashioning tools, which he could use to hunt and control the environment around him. Jim however, was less inclined to work, getting greater satisfaction from sitting around munching on walnuts and watching a sunset. One Tuesday afternoon, while he was engrossed in watching a caterpillar crawl across a leaf, Jim's career as a caveman was cut short as he ended up the featured item on the lunch menu of a saber-toothed tiger. Lemarr survived, and had several children who became our remote ancestors, and his trait of enjoying hard work was passed down to us. Or at least so goes evolutionary theory. But regardless of the etiology, there is evidence to support the notion that human beings seem to be born with an innate capacity to get a sense of satisfaction from the work they do. In addition, there is a well-"

Psychologists and social scientists first began to explore the relationship between work satisfaction and life satisfaction in the 1950s, and since that time, researchers have accumulated a massive amount of data confirming the link between happiness at work and overall happiness in life. In 1989, psychologists Marianne Tait, Margaret Youtz Padgett, and Timothy T. Baldwin reviewed the existing literature over the previous thirty years, and firmly established the link between work and life satisfaction. This link holds true whether one is a man or a woman, blue-collar or white-collar, whether one works on Wall Street or, as found in a recent study by Roderick Iverson and Catherine Maguire at the University of Melbourne, one works in a remote coal-mining community in Australia. Since the 1989 study, organizational psychologists, social scientists, and leading experts such as Robert Rice, Timothy Judge, and Shinichiro Watanabe have continued to examine the relationship between work and happiness, further refining our understanding of the nature of the relationship. As one might intuitively guess, many investigators have proposed a <bi-directional spillover> model of job/life satisfaction. In other words, satisfaction with one's work tends to make one happier overall, and those who are happy with their life tend to be happier at work. Of course, as in most fields of research, there is some disagreement among researchers about the degree to which work influences overall happiness or to what degree a person's general happiness in life spills over into his or her job. In looking at the link between work and life satisfaction, some researchers have even tried to quantify the relationship. A"

In summarizing some of the literature on the subject, James Harter, Frank Schmidt, and Corey Keyes report, <As much as a fifth to a quarter of the variation in adult life satisfaction can be accounted for by satisfaction with work.> While on the surface this may not appear to be a high number, when one takes into account all of the variables that may affect life satisfaction, including marital status, social supports outside of work, health, and other life circumstances, one can begin to appreciate the tremendous role that work can potentially play in a happy and satisfied life. It seems clear that human beings have an innate ability to experience satisfaction through work, and further, there's a link between work satisfaction and life satisfaction. Lucky for us, since a major portion of our allotted time on earth is spent working. Still, it may require some effort to identify and remove the obstacles that prevent us from experiencing the joy at work that is our birthright. In our discussions, the Dalai Lama had offered an approach to beginning that process. But there was still something bothering me, still something missing. Noting that the Dalai Lama always seemed so happy no matter what activity he was engaged in, I had begun our discussions by questioning him about how he views his own work or job, in an attempt to discover what role work played in his own sense of fulfillment and happiness. My initial efforts in getting him to talk about his own job had proved fruitless, but now I thought it worthwhile to return to the subject once again.

A thought suddenly occurred to me as I remembered a brief exchange that had taken place the year before, while the Dalai Lama was in the middle of an intensive three-week speaking tour in the U.S. It was the end of an exhausting day. The Dalai Lama was in the final moments of a public address, given in a large Midwestern city. As customary, in the final minutes of his talk, he was fielding the standard questions from the audience, ranging from <What's the current status of the political situation in Tibet?> to <Do you have a girlfriend?> Sitting on a folding chair backstage, I was on the verge of nodding off, when I suddenly became fully alert, startled by a question I had not heard before, a simple yet fundamental question that somehow I had failed to ask him during our many meetings over the years. <You often speak about happiness,> he was asked, <and you even claim that the purpose of our existence is happiness. So, I'm wondering, when was your happiest moment?> The Dalai Lama was slow to reply, as if he had all the time in the world. When he finally answered, it was if he were chatting with a group of friends while drinking tea on the front porch of his home, instead of addressing thousands in a public arena, all of whom were eagerly anticipating his response. <I don't know,> he mused quietly, almost under his breath. <There have been so many happy moments, so many.> Finally he laughed. <I think that perhaps it was when I passed my Geshe exams. I remember it was such a relief when it was finished, I was so happy!> Booming over the loudspeakers, his mirthful laugh resounded throughout the arena, reverberating in the hearts of each of his listeners."

The reality of the situation was far different. The Geshe degree, akin to a PhD in Buddhist philosophy, is the culmination of seventeen years of hard work. It involves intensive study of many branches of Buddhist theory, logic, debate, and psychology. His field of study was riddled with arcane topics, and with courses so tough that I'd have to dust off my dictionary even to find out what the course title meant: <Let's see epistemology 'the study of the nature of knowledge.'> The oral exam lasted a full day, as Tibet's top scholars from the country's best monastic universities fired questions at him in front of thousands of monks and scholars. Added to this tremendous pressure for Tibet's young leader, the political situation in Tibet was so tense that for the first time in history there were armed guards, both Tibetan and Chinese, poised around the large courtyard, waiting for trouble to erupt at any moment. There had been a threat to his life, which he had been made aware of. While one's happiness from passing a final exam is understandable, this wasn't what I would have thought of as a peaceful happy moment, and it was hard to imagine a situation more rife with internal and external challenges and pressures. Yet he claimed that this was his happiest moment, or at least one of them. To me, the implications of his response went beyond the"

Yes, once again here I was seeking soundbite solutions and being offered nothing but unrelenting reminders of the complexity of human beings. But he's right, of course. Although from a Darwinian perspective, we may have inherited from our remote ancestors an inborn propensity to experience pleasure and satisfaction from productive activity, we are no longer primarily a hunter-gatherer society.

And as he suggested earlier, even one's national and cultural background can play a role, a fact that has been well documented by industrial and organizational psychologist Paul Spector in a recent book on job satisfaction. Not only are there many variables or factors that can affect job satisfaction, there are also many factors that contribute to a happy life. As the Dalai Lama reminds us, job satisfaction is just one of those factors. There are many components to human happiness. Ed Diener, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and one of the leading researchers in the field of subjective well-being, in looking at the extensive research on the factors that can influence human happiness, has concluded that it <seems likely that subjective wellbeing will not be accounted for by a handful of potent variables, because of the immense number of factors that can influence it.> So, given the complexity of human beings, given the wide variety of biological, social, economic, or demographic variables that can affect our happiness at work or at home, where do we begin?

I still sensed that by learning a bit more about how he views his own work and how his work fits into his life, that there was something that could be helpful to others\u2014something that we could apply to our own work and to our own lives. So, giving it one last shot, I said, >This week we've spoken about people's attitudes toward their work, the different views that people can have of their jobs. And I'm still curious about your own views of your work. The other day I asked what you would tell someone who asked you what you do for a living, and you said you'd tell them you do nothing, or joked that you just take care of yourself, and so on. But I'd still like to get more specific. I mean, in your case, you have various roles: you're an ordained monk, you're the leader of the Tibetan people, you're a statesman, a teacher, a Buddhist scholar, and you give talks and participate in various kinds of conferences all around the world. You're involved in lots of activities, so that's kind of what"

So accordingly the work of a monk, or main interest, is the study and practice of Buddhism. And then the main thing is to serve others through spirituality, through my own experience. That's the main thing, isn't it? So, when I give talks, I'm trying to share with those people some understanding of what is beneficial, what is a meaningful life, according to my own experience. <Now, if you are talking about my temporal work, my work in the world, my activities and my decisions are based on Buddhist principles. They are based on both the Buddhist concept of great compassion and the view of interdependence. For example, my Middle Way policy, my approach to the Tibetan political issue, is shaped by my view of interdependence, recognizing that in today's world all countries are interdependent. Naturally, for Tibet much depends on India, and much depends on China. So in that policy you also see the influence of Buddhist concepts such as nonviolence. We don't go to war with the Chinese to get our country back. So I think all my different activities are influenced by Buddhist concepts. Well, maybe not everything I might do a little work with a screwdriver, and I don't know whether Buddhist concepts are involved there. I don't know> he laughed <otherwise I think the main or major part of my daily life is spent as a monk, as a Buddhist practitioner. So, for example, I'll wake up each morning at threethirty and engage in study, prayer, and meditation. Of course, my brother teases me that I wake up so early because I'm hun"

Otherwise, there's nothing else, zero.> <O.K.,> I said, <but I know that you have many daily activities besides your spiritual practices as a Buddhist monk. You mentioned, for example, the political situation, and I know that you have duties and work related to your role as leader of the Tibetan people. To what extent do your other kinds of work, such as your political duties, contribute to your overall sense of happiness and satisfaction? Do you feel that it plays a role?> The Dalai Lama explained, <There is definitely a correlation between the satisfaction that you achieve in the workplace and your overall sense of fulfillment. However, I am not sure whether my own personal experience here can be applied to the experiences of many other individuals. For example, this morning I was talking with some members of the Tibetan secretariat here and I was making the point that if, for example, we read Tibetan history, we see that through many generations we Tibetans have neglected the important changes going on around us so that we have now arrived at a point where much of the damage done is almost irreparable. So, in a way, my generation of Tibetans has inherited a crisis that has had tragic consequences for our culture and people as a whole. Yet at the same time, being a Tibetan, and especially being the Dalai Lama at such a critical juncture, provides me a tremendous opportunity to serve, to serve the well-being of a people and ensure the survival of its culture.> <So that seems to relate to what we had discussed about chal"

        "content": "lenge the other day. You are saying that the greater the challenge, the greater the sense of satisfaction one might derive from work?< I asked. >Yes, certainly. For example, in the case of my own responsibility for the Tibetan people and nation, as I mentioned, our present tragedy is in fact the result of many complex factors, including Tibet's own long period of negligence and ignorance of the events in the outside world. Yet when I recognize the gravity of the situation, the fact that the very survival of Tibetans as a people with their unique cultural heritage is threatened, I can then appreciate the value of even the smallest contribution I can make toward safeguarding the Tibetan people. This, in turn, reinforces my understanding of how my work in relation to the issue of Tibet is in actual fact part of my lifelong daily spiritual practice, the practice of someone who deeply believes that helping others is the highest goal of a spiritual practitioner. In this way, in my own life, my work becomes intimately connected with my daily prayer and meditation practice. For example, I find the use of analytical meditation helpful to generate deeper conviction in the principles of nonviolence, of compassion, of forgiveness, especially toward the Communist Chinese. So you see, there is a kind of mutual influence between my commitment to certain spiritual values, my daily spiritual practice, their impact on my overall thinking and attitude to life, and how these in turn affect my political work for the people of Tibet. Then, my political work influences my spiritual practice. In fact, there is an interconnected relationship between everything. If I enjoy a good breakfast, for instance, it contributes to my health. And if I enjoy good health, it's possible to utilize my"

I finally understood how the Dalai Lama could claim >I do nothing< as his job description. Of course, I knew that with his lighthearted humor, there was a tongue-in-cheek element to this job description. And behind his joking about doing >nothing,< I knew of his natural reluctance, which I have observed on many occasions, to engage in unnecessary self-appraisal. This seemed to grow out of his lack of self-involvement, absence of self-absorption, and lack of concern for how others view his work, as long as he had sincere motivation to be of help to others. But there was a deeper truth here as well. As I had begun to understand during our discussion of personal strengths, he is someone who has completely fused his self with his work. His personal life and work life were perfectly integrated\u2014so fully integrated, in fact, that there was no separation between his >personal< life, >work< life, >spiritual< life, or >home< life. And since he did not separate out a particular set of functions and relegate them to a >job< category, he had no job. >I do nothing.< I have often marveled, in fact, at how he carries his full self with"

He is who he is, the same whether he's at home or <at work.> There must be an immense feeling of freedom in that kind of life, I mused. I thought back to an extraordinary scene I had witnessed the previous year. The Dalai Lama was visiting Washington, D.C., and one evening he attended a reception held in his honor at the Capitol building. The reception was given by Senator Diane Feinstein, and was attended by Washington's elite, a virtual who's who of Washington power brokers. The event was held in the richly decorated Appropriations room in the Senate side of the Capitol building. Ambassadors, high-ranking senators, and leaders of Congress glided silently across the plush red carpet, under ornate crystal chandeliers, surrounded by fresco-like murals in muted colors covering the walls and ceiling. The setting served as an appropriate backdrop to underscore the prominence of those present. I recognized many faces that I had often seen on television, but there was something unsettling about seeing these people in person. I wasn't sure why. Then, it occurred to me\u2014many of these people didn't seem to be any more <live> than when I viewed them on TV. I looked closely at many of these leaders of Congress, their deeply lined faces frozen into an impenetrable mask, their movements stiff and automatic.

I had arrived early, and people were milling about. The older and more established guests seemed to be so secure in their positions, and so overwhelmed by their own self-importance, that they seemed to take little interest in anyone else. When they were introduced to someone, they looked right through them, barely acknowledging that there was another human standing in front of them. The younger or less secure, by far the majority, seemed to be equally oblivious to those they were talking to, as their eyes constantly darted about the room, trying to determine their place in the hierarchy of power. Some made their way through the crowd introducing themselves, and as I would later mention to the Dalai Lama, the most common question, was <What do you do?> They seemed to have a talent for sizing you up\u2014within sixteen nanoseconds, they could determine if there was any way that you could be useful to them. If not, they were soon off, jostling their way through the room to meet someone more important. Some sipped on diet Cokes or white wine, and there was a long banquet table in the middle of the room laden with imported cheeses, fried shrimp, puff pastries, and assorted delicacies. The food remained largely untouched. Many appeared to be too tense to eat. I looked around the room and saw few who looked relaxed and happy. Finally, the Dalai Lama entered the room. The contrast was striking. As usual, he appeared calm and cheerful. I noticed that he hadn't even bothered to put on his good leather Rockports\u2014 he was wearing his old rubber thongs.

He poured himself a glass of water while Senator Feinstein dragged a heavy antique dark oak chair across the room, pushing it against a wall and inviting the Dalai Lama to sit. Several senators lined up to be introduced. Standing across the room, I could not hear what they were saying, but observing the way that he engaged them\u2014with a sincere handshake, warm guileless smile and direct eye contact\u2014it was apparent that as always, he was relating to them just as one human being to another, with a complete lack of pretense. Soon there was the inevitable smile on the others' faces, even their posture relaxed. I noticed that after they were introduced, many of the guests lingered and seemed reluctant to leave. Finally, one senator pulled up a chair next to the Dalai Lama. The next in the receiving line did the same. Soon there were a dozen politicians seated along the wall, a half dozen on each side of the Dalai Lama. Observing how they leaned toward him attentively, engrossed in conversation, from across the room, the scene reminded me of the Last Supper. It seemed that the closer they were to the Dalai Lama, the more their faces and posture relaxed. Turning back a few minutes later, I was struck by an even more extraordinary sight\u2014the Dalai Lama was affectionately holding the hand of the man seated next to him, a well-known seasoned old politician whom he had just met. He held the politician's hand as he would the hand of a small child, and the politician, who just moments before had appeared hard and impenetrable, suddenly seemed to visibly soften, suddenly seemed to become more human.

He had been assigned the same duty on some of the Dalai Lama's previous visits to the U.S., and told me that providing security for him was his favorite assignment\u2014not only because unlike some of the other diplomats who wanted to go to discos until three in the morning, the Dalai Lama was in bed each night by nine, but also because he had a genuine admiration for him. He explained, <I'm not a Buddhist, of course, but the Dalai Lama really has inspired me.> <In what way?> I asked. <I guess the main thing is that I've noticed that he likes to talk with the drivers, the janitors and waiters, the service staff wherever he goes. And he treats everybody just the same.> There was no place that this was more evident than what I had just witnessed here at the Capitol. He treated all with equal respect. There was no difference between how the Dalai Lama treated the food server and the senate majority leader. His demeanor, his bearing, his speech, and his behavior were always exactly the same, whether he was speaking to the maid in the hotel, the driver on the way to a reception, or to the top politicians in the U.S. So here was the answer since he had no need for pretense, for acting a certain way in public or while <at work,> and another way in private, and could just be himself wherever he went, this made his work seem effortless. Of course, most of us have a long way to go before reaching that level of integration, but the more we can reduce the gap between who we are and what we do, the more effortless our work will become."
