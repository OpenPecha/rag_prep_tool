    "1": "Chapter\nl\nTRANSFORMING\nDISSATISFACTION AT WORK\nIt\nhad been a long day for the Dalai Lama. Even by the time he\nhad eaten his meager breakfast of tsampa\n] and tea at 7:30 A.M.,\nhe had already been up for four hours, completing his rigorous\ndaily regimen of prayer, study, and meditation. After breakfast\nhe began his usual workday, and that day there was a full line-\nup: meeting with one person after another, he saw an Indian\ngovernment liaison officer, the head lama of one of the ancient\nlineages of Tibetan Buddhism, the president of a member re-\npublic of the Russian Federation, a high official in the Tibetan\ngovernment-in-exile, and various members of his private office\nstaff. And scheduled among these private meetings,\nI watched\nwith admiration as he met with a group of newly arrived Ti-\n1 Tsampa\nis a traditional Tibetan staple food.\nIt is made from roasted barley\nflour eaten in the form of a dryish dough mixed with tea.\n11\n"
