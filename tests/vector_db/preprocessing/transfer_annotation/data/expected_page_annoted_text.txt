TRANSFORMING
DISSATISFACTION AT WORK
It had been a long day for the Dalai Lama. Even by the time he
had eaten his meager breakfast of tsampa and tea at 7:30 A.M.,
he had already been up for four hours, completing his rigorous
daily regimen of prayer, study, and meditation. After breakfast
he began his usual workday, and that day there was a full lineup:
meeting with one person after another, he saw an Indian
government liaison officer, the head lama of one of the ancient
lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, the president of a member republic
of the Russian Federation, a high official in the Tibetan
government-in-exile, and various members of his private office
staff. And scheduled among these private meetings, I watched
with admiration as he met with a group of newly arrived Ti

of these people, however, a mere glimpse of the Dalai Lama,
the fulfillment of a lifelong dream, was enough to revive their
withered spirits and infuse them with renewed hope and joy.
He offered them all, young and old, words of hope and encouragement,
as well as hardheaded practical advice, ranging
from "Education is critical to success" to "Now you men
should be careful of going with prostitutesâ€”you could catch a
disease."
Finally, it was 2 P.M., his last scheduled appointment for the
day. And here was I. I had been allotted several hours each afternoon
to collaborate on our book, and I was here to collect.
Our meetings were far from chatty tete-a-tetes, however. In
fact, I often gave him no end of difficulty as we struggled to reconcile
East and West, pestering him with endless questions, a
fair proportion of which he labeled so silly or impossible to an
