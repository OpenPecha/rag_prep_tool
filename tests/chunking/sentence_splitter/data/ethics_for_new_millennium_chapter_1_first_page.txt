Chapter One
MODERN SOCIETY AND THE QUEST FOR HUMAN HAPPINESS
I AM A COMPARATIVE NEWCOMER TO THE MODERN world. Although I fled my
homeland as long ago as 1959, and although my life since then as a refugee in India has
brought me into much closer contact with contemporary society, my formative years
were spent largely cut off from the realities of the twentieth century. This was partly
due to my appointment as Dalai Lama: I became a monk at a very early age. It also
reflects the fact that we Tibetans had chosen—mistakenly, in my view—to remain
isolated behind the high mountain ranges which separate our country from the rest of
the world.
Today, however, I travel a great deal, and it is my good fortune continuously to be
meeting new people. Moreover, individuals from all walks of life come to see me. Quite
a lot—especially those who make the effort to travel to the Indian hill-station at
Dharamsala where I live in exile—arrive seeking something. Among these are people
who have suffered greatly: some have lost parents and children; some have friends or
family who committed suicide; are sick with cancer and with AIDS-related illnesses.
Then, of course, there are fellow Tibetans with their own tales of hardship and
suffering. Unfortunately, many have unrealistic expectations, supposing that I have
healing powers or that I can give some sort of blessing. But I am only an ordinary
human being. The best I can do is try to help them by sharing in their suffering.
For my part, meeting innumerable others from all over the world and from every walk of
life reminds me of our basic sameness as human beings. Indeed, the more I see of the
world, the clearer it becomes that no matter what our situation, whether we are rich or
poor, educated or not, of one race, gender, religion or another, we all desire to be happy
and to avoid suffering. Our every intended action, in a sense our whole life—how we
choose to live it within the context of the limitations imposed by our circumstances—can
be seen as our answer to the great question which confronts us all: “How am I to be
happy?”
We are sustained in this great quest for happiness, it seems to me, by hope. We know,
even if we do not admit it, that there can be no guarantee of a better, happier life than
the one we are leading today. As an old Tibetan proverb puts it, The next life or
tomorrow—we can never be certain which will come first. But we hope to go on living.
We hope that through this or that action we can bring about happiness. Everything we
do, not only as individuals but also at the level of society, can be seen in terms of this
fundamental aspiration. Indeed, it is one shared by all sentient beings. The desire or
inclination to be happy and to avoid suffering knows no boundaries. It is in our nature.
As such, it needs no justification and is validated by the simple fact that we naturally
and correctly want this.
And this is precisely what we see in countries both rich and poor. Everywhere, by all
means imaginable, people are striving to improve their lives. Yet strangely, my
impression is that those living in the materially developed countries, for all their
industry, are in some ways less satisfied, are less happy, and to some extent suffer more
than those living in the least developed countries. Indeed, if we compare the rich with
the poor, it often seems that those with nothing are, in fact, the least anxious, though
they are plagued with physical pains and suffering. As for the rich, while a few know
how to use their wealth intelligently—that is to say, not in luxurious living but by
sharing it with the needy—many do not. They are so caught up with the idea of
acquiring still more that they make no room for anything else in their lives. In their
absorption, they actually lose the dream of happiness, which riches were to have
provided. As a result, they are constantly tormented, torn between doubt about what
might happen and the hope of gaining more, and plagued with mental and emotional
suffering—even though outwardly they may appear to be leading entirely successful and
comfortable lives. This is suggested both by the high degree and by the disturbing
prevalence among the populations of the materially developed countries of anxiety,
